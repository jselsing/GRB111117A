\abstract{
Short $\gamma$-ray bursts (sGRBs) and their hosts are notoriously difficult to localize. We here present a spectroscopic observation of the host galaxy of GRB 111117A and measure its redshift to be $z = 2.211$, making it the most distant high-confidence short GRB with a secure redshift measurement. This value supersedes a previously estimated, lower redshift value. Spectroscopic observations along with a wealth of imaging data allow us to place tight constraints on the nature of the host galaxy at an unprecedented distance. 
The rest frame X-ray derived hydrogen column density is high compared to a complete sample of sGRBs and seems to follow the evolution with redshift as traced by the hosts of long GRBs (lGRBs). This could indicate that the part of the sGRB population hosted in late-type galaxies live in similar environments to that of lGRB hosts. 
The host lies in the brighter end of the expected host brightness distribution at $z = 2.211$, and is actively star forming. Using the host as a benchmark for redshift determination, we assess that only 30 per cent of sGRB redshifts should be missed due to host faintness at this redshift. This indicates that we are not missing redshifts for a dominant fraction of the sGRB hosts at this redshift. The redshift of GRB~111117A is evidence against a lognormal delay-time model for sGRBs through the predicted redshift distribution of sGRBs, which is very sensitive to high-z sGRBs.
%From the age of the universe at explosion time, an initial progenitor separation of a$_0 < 3.2 $R$_\odot$ is required for the case of a binary neutron star (NS) system. This puts constraints on the progenitor system evolution up to the time of explosion.

\section{Introduction}


There is now mounting evidence that most short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) come from the merger of neutron stars (NSs), either with another NS, or a black hole, due to their apparent association with kilonovae \citep{Barnes2013a, Tanvir2013b, Yang2015, Jin2016, Rosswog2016}. The absence of associated supernovae in deep searches \citep[e.g.][]{Hjorth2005a,Fox2005,Hjorth2005b} supports this idea and distinguishes the physical origin of sGRBs from their long-duration counterparts.
%\citep[albeit see also][]{Fynbo2006b, Valle2006, Gal-Yam2006}. 
The range of host galaxy types, in some cases apparently absent, and typically more massive 
and on average less actively star-forming than long GRB hosts  \citep{Fong2013b}, as well as their positions within hosts \citep{Fong2013a}, suggest an origin for the progenitors that can be very long-lived, and associated with stellar mass rather than purely star-formation rate \citep{Berger2014}. The bulk of sGRBs have associated galaxies at relatively low redshifts with a median $z\sim0.5$ \citep{Berger2014} and because most redshifts are measured from the hosts, this value is biased towards low $z$.
%This progress on the progenitors of sGRBs has been enabled by the afterglow detection and burst localization by the \emph{Swift} satellite \citep{Gehrels2009a}. The bulk of these localizations have associated galaxies at relatively low redshifts with a median $z\sim0.5$ \citep{Berger2014} and because most redshifts are measured from the hosts, this value is biased towards low $z$. 

%So far, the electromagnetic signal from sGRBs are the only means to accurately localize NS mergers and holds the promise for detection of an associated gravitational wave signal \citep{Ghirlanda2016}. From the burst and following afterglow, modeling the properties and mapping the environments additionally allows insights into the phenomenon itself. 

The total lifetimes of NS binaries is dependent on their initial separations and subsequent inspiral times, and impacts the timing and distribution of the enrichment of the ISM and subsequent stars and planets with heavy $r$-process elements \citep{VandeVoort2015, Wallner2015,  Ji2016}. Some limits can be calculated based on models of star-formation histories of, and the spatial distribution of sGRBs in, their host galaxies \citep[][]{Berger2014}. The most distant cosmological bursts, however, offer direct, hard limits.

In this \emph{Letter} we present the spectrum of the host galaxy of the short GRB 111117A at z=2.211, a significantly higher redshift than the previously estimated redshift based on photometric studies. We present the rest frame burst properties based on this new distance
compared to previous analyses \citep{Margutti2012,Sakamoto2013} and revisit the host properties derived from the new solution to the SED fit. 
%While no optical afterglow was detected, the excellent localization from a detection
%of the X-ray afterglow by the \emph{Chandra X-ray Observatory} also allows
%us to discuss the positioning and environmental properties of this remarkably
%distant short GRB.  

Throughout this \emph{Letter} we use the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology provided by
\citet{Planck2015} in which the universe is flat with $H_0 = 67.7$ km s$^{-1}$ and
$\Omega_m = 0.307$ and report all magnitudes in the AB system.

\subsection{Spectroscopic observations and analysis}

	\label{fig:spec_setup}
\end{figure}


%(21000 \AA when the K-band blocking filter is used)
Spectroscopic observations were carried out using the cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph, VLT/X-shooter \citep{Vernet2011}, in four seperate epochs. The burst was followed up 38 hours after the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) trigger under ESO programme 088.A-0051 (PI: Fynbo) and again later using a different ESO program 091.D-0904 (PI: Hjorth). X-shooter can cover the wavelength range from 3000 \AA~to 24800 \AA~across three spectroscopic arms, simultaneously illuminated through the use of dichroics. The bias-correction, flat-fielding, order tracing, wavelength calibration, rectification, and flux calibration is then carried out using the VLT/X-shooter pipeline version 2.8.4 \citep{Goldoni2006, Modigliani2010} and managed by Reflex \citep{Freudling2013}. Because the spectra are curved across each detector, a rectification algorithm is employed which introduces correlations between neighboring pixels. We select a pixel-scale of 0.2/0.2/0.6 \AA/pix for the UVB/VIS/NIR arm to minimize the degree of correlation while conserving the maximal resolution. The observations are combined and extracted using scripts described in Selsing et al. 2017 (in prep.) and available online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jselsing/XSGRB_reduction_scripts}}. The signal-to-noise of the continuum in the near-infrared arm is too low to use the optimal extraction algorithm \citep{Horne1986} and therefore the extraction is carried out with a simple aperture.
An overview of the spectroscopic observations is given in Tab. \ref{tab:spec_overview}, and the position of the slit on the target is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:spec_setup}.

% \begin{figure}

% 	\label{fig:SED}
% \end{figure}

We determine a redshift of $z = 2.211$ from the simultaneous detection of emission lines interpreted as \lya, \oii, \hb, \oiii$\lambda$5007, and \ha, with \hb~detected at low significance ($\sim 3 \sigma$). \ha~is only visible in the first epoch, due to the K-band blocking filter used for the remainder observations. The nebular lines exhibit a spatial extent of $\sim$ 1\farc5 and show significant velocity structure along the slit. A drop in the continuum to the blue of the \lya~line further supports the inferred redshift.

%The total extent of the lines in velocity space is $\sim$ 450 km/s. The line profiles shows an asymmetric "double-horned" profile, indicating that we are seeing a galaxy with a large degree of coherent rotational motion relative to the line-of-sight. If we assume that we are viewing a spiral galaxy exactly edge-on, this is a measure of the rotational velocity of the gas. If we assume that the spectral resolution and the turbulent width of the lines are negligible compared to the rotational velocity, we can based on the projected size of the source and the width of the lines, put a constraint on the dynamical mass of the galaxy. Based on the physical scale from extent and the velocity with, we infer M$_\text{dyn} \gtrsim 10^{10.8}$ M$_\odot$. Because we are viewing the host at an angle, this value is an upper limit, which should be divided by $\sin(i)$, where $i$ is the inclination relative to edge-on. 

Using the integrated flux of \ha, we can infer the SFR \citep{Kennicutt1998, Moustakas2006}. From the SED-fit, see Sect. \ref{SED}, and the detection of \lya, the host is constrained to contain very little or no dust which is also confirmed by the shape of the spectral continuum, which is why we do not apply a dust-correction. Because of the redshift, \ha~falls on the far end of the NIR-arm where the night sky is very bright and additionally, several bright sky-lines intersect the line, making an accurate estimate of the \ha-flux difficult. %Because of the challenging measurement, two approaches are employed. First, 
A limit on the SFR is obtained by integrating the part of \ha~free of contamination and conservatively correcting for the missing fraction by assessing the fraction integrated. Converting to a \citet{Chabrier2003} initial mass function using \citet{Madau2014} we get a limit of SFR > 7 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. %Secondly, based on the width of \oiii, an aperture covering the line is integrated over, where synthetic sky lines \citep{Noll2012, Jones2013} have been masked and interpolated over. From the integrated \ha-line, we estimate SFR = $18 \pm 3$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figures/OIII_img.pdf}
	\caption{2D-image of the \oiii$\lambda$5007 emission line. The location of a bright skyline is marked by the blue box. The location of the emission line is indicated with the red ellipse. Because the host is observed in nodding-mode, negative images of the emission line appear on both sides in the spatial direction.}
	\label{fig:line}
\end{figure}

%A measure of the optical-to-X-ray flux ratio is parametrized in terms of the "darkness"-parameter $\beta_{OX}$\citep{Jakobsson2004}. Using the optical afterglow limits\citep{Cucchiara2011, Cenko2011}, the X-ray lightcurve can be interpolated and evaluated at the time of the non-detection. We find $\beta_{OX} < 0.79$, consistent with what was reported in \citet{Sakamoto2013}.

%Because the projected distance does not change much between redshift 1.3 and 2.1, all conclusions of \citet{Margutti2012} and \citet{Sakamoto2013} relating to host offset are unaffected. 

\subsection{Imaging observations and SED analysis} \label{SED}

We additionally imaged the field of GRB 111117A in multiple broad-band filters using the VLT equipped with FORS2 ($gRIz$ filters) and HAWK-I ($JHK_{\mathrm{s}}$ filters), long after the burst has faded. These new data are complemented by a re-analysis of some of the imagery used in \citet{Margutti2012} and \citet{Sakamoto2013} that are available to us here (GTC $gri$-band, TNG $R$-band, and Gemini $z$-band). A log of the photometric observations and measured brightnesses is given in Tab.~\ref{tab:phot_overview}.

All data were reduced, analyzed and fitted in a similar manner as we have done previously and described in detail in \citet{Kruhler2011a} and, more recently, in \citet{Schulze2016}. Very briefly, we use our own python and IRAF routines to perform a consistent standard reduction of the available imaging which includes bias/flat-field correction, de-fringing (if necessary), sky-subtraction, and stacking of individual images for a given instrument in a given filter. The photometry of the host was tied against magnitudes of field stars from the SDSS and 2MASS catalogs in the case of $grizJHK_{\mathrm{s}}$ filters. For our $R$ and $I$-band photometry we used the color transformations of Lupton\footnote{\url{https://www.sdss3.org/dr8/algorithms/sdssUBVRITransform.php}}. We subsequently convert all magnitudes into the AB system if necessary, and correct for the Galactic foreground of $E_{B-V}=0.027~\mathrm{mag}$.

The multi-color spectral energy distribution (SED) is then fit by \citet{Bruzual2003} stellar population synthesis models based on a \citet{Chabrier2003} initial mass function in \emph{LePhare} \citep{Ilbert2006}, where the redshift is fixed to the spectroscopic value of $z=2.211$. The best model is obtained with an unreddened galaxy template, and returns physical parameters of luminosity ($M_B=-22.0\pm0.1$\,mag), stellar mass ($\log(M_{\star}/M_\odot) = 9.9\pm0.2$), single stellar population age ($\tau = 0.5_{-0.25}^{+0.5}$ Gyr) and star-formation rate ($SFR_{\mathrm{SED}}=11_{-4}^{+9} M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$). %We show the SED fit in Fig. \ref{fig:SED}.

Noteworthy is the discrepancy of both our new VLT/FORS2 photometry and the re-analysis of Gemini data to the $z$-band data of \citet{Margutti2012} and \citet{Sakamoto2013}. Both report $z$-band photometry brighter by 0.8-1.0 mag than what we derive here, whereas bluer data are in excellent agreement with previously published values.

In fact, the large $i-z$ color is mistakenly interpreted as a 4000\,\AA\,break driving the galaxy photometric redshift of both of these earlier works. Using the revised photometry from Table~\ref{tab:phot_overview}, the photo-$z$ of the galaxy is $z_{\mathrm{phot}}=2.04_{-0.21}^{+0.19}$, consistent with the spectroscopic value at the 1~$\sigma$ confidence level.

\subsection{XRT temporal and spectral analysis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We retrieved the automated data products provided by the \textit{Swift}-XRT GRB repository\footnote{\url{http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt\_products/00507901.} \todo{Broken link, Paolo?}} \citep{Evans2009}. The X-ray afterglow light curve can be fit with a single power-law decay with index $\alpha=1.27_{-0.10}^{+0.12}$. We performed a time-integrated spectral analysis using data in photon counting (PC) mode in the widest time epoch where the $0.3-1.5\,\mathrm{keV}$ to $1.5-10\,\mathrm{keV}$ hardness ratio is constant (namely, from $t-T_0 = 205$ s to $t-T_0 = 203.5$ ks, for a total of 29.1 ks of data), in order to prevent spectral changes that can affect the X-ray column density determination. The obtained spectrum is well described by an absorbed power-law model. The best-fit spectral parameters are a photon index of $2.1 \pm 0.4$ and an intrinsic $N_{H}$ of $2.4_{-1.6}^{+2.4} \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($z=2.211$), assuming the Galactic $N_{H}$ in the burst direction of $4.1 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Classification}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As already pointed out \citep{Margutti2012, Sakamoto2013}, GRB~111117A very securely belongs the short class of GRBs. Because the observed classification indicators, $T_{90}$ and hardness ratio, do not depend strongly on redshift \citep{Littlejohns2013a}, the updated redshift does not change this designation significantly. The intrinsic luminosity increases, as visible in the light curve in Fig. \ref{fig:sxray_lightcurve}, but it still is sub-luminous compared to majority of long GRBs. 
\citet{Bromberg2013} investigated the degree to which the long and short population distributions overlap and quantified the certainty in the class membership. GRB~111117A has $96_{-5}^{+3}$ percent probability of being short. Compared to the other two highest-z short candidates, GRB060121 \citep{DeUgartePostigo2006, Levan2006} at $1.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 4.5$ ($17_{-15}^{+14}$ per cent) and GRB090426 \citep{Antonelli2009, Levesque2010, Thone2011} at $z = 2.609$ ($10_{-10}^{+15}$ per cent), the certainty in class membership for GRB~111117A is much higher.

The grey shared region is a compilation of long GRB lightcurves where the color represents density and the light blue is other short GRB lightcurves for which redshifts has been determined. Despite the remarkably high redshift, the burst’s luminosity is comparable to the bulk of the short burst population and still subluminous compared to the lGRB population.}

\end{figure}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Restframe $N_H$}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We plot the recalculated $N_H$ in Fig. \ref{fig:NH_z} where we compare with the distributions of complete samples of both long and short GRBs. The long sample is from \citet{Arcodia2016} and the short sample is from \citet{DAvanzo2014a}. 17 of the 99 long bursts do not have redshifts and likewise for 5 out of 16 for the short sample. Bursts without redshifts have been excluded for both groups. GRB~111117A occupies a unique position in Fig. \ref{fig:NH_z} with the highest $N_H$ of all short burst. The short sample, excluding GRB~111117A, is located at low redshifts(z < 1) and are found to populate a similar column density environment to long GRBs at similar redshifts \citep{DAvanzo2014a}. The inferred hydrogen column for GRB~111117A seems to follow the trend with increasing $N_H$ as a function of redshift as found for the long GRB hosts \citep{Arcodia2016}.

% \end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Host galaxy}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%From the clear host association, GRB~111117A does not belong to the hostless class of GRBs \citep{Berger2010a} and because the host exhibits clear emission lines indicative of a population of relatively young stars, 
As the majority of short GRBs \citep{Fong2013b}, the host of GRB~111117A is a late-type galaxy and is entirely consistent in terms of stellar mass and stellar age with the general population of short GRB hosts($\left\langle M _* \right\rangle = 10^{10.1} M_{\odot}$ and $\left\langle \tau _* \right\rangle = 0.3 $ Gyr) \citet{Leibler2010}. The SFR, on the other hand, is $\sim$1 order of magnitude higher than the typical SFR for short GRB hosts galaxies \citep{Berger2014} and more similar to the SFRs found in the hosts of long GRBs at a corresponding redshift \citep{Kruhler2015}. Only two hosts in the sample of short GRBs compiled in \citet{Berger2014} have a more vigorous star formation, meaning that it is in the very upper end of the star formation distribution, while not a complete outlier. This is likely a selection effect, because a less star-forming galaxy would exhibit weaker emission lines, thus making the redshift harder to determine. Being a late-type host, both the stellar mass and sSFR are entirely consistent with the expected host of sGRBs\citep{Behroozi2014}.
That we detect \lya~is consistent with the SED-inferred absence of dust, despite the moderate stellar age and the high X-ray derived hydrogen column density which would suggest the opposite. The centroid of the Ly$\alpha$ emission is found to be redshifted by $\sim$ 220 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to systemic, which is similar to what is found for long GRB hosts \citep{Milvang-Jensen2012a} where the outflow is attributed to star formation.

\section{Implications for redshift distribution of short GRBs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A single sGRB at high redshift does little in terms of constraints on the redshift distribution and therethrough the progenitor channels, but other short hosts could be missed because they are intrinsically fainter and thus this high-z event is only detected due to the brightness of the host. \citet{Berger2014} compiled a sample of sGRB host luminosities, normalized by the characteristic galaxy luminosity at their respective redshift, $L_B/L^{\star}_{B}$. 26 out of 39 hosts (66 per cent) in the sample has redshifts. To convert the SED-inferred $M_B$ of GRB~111117A to $L_B/L^{\star}_{B}$, we use the characteristic absolute B-band magnitude of the Schechter function for the blue galaxies ($U - V < 0.25$) in the redshift window $2.0 \leq z \leq 2.5$ from \citet{Marchesini2007} and find $L_B/L^{\star}_{B} = 1.2$, which is brighter than 70 per cent of the hosts in \citet{Berger2014} with measured $L_B/L^{\star}_{B}$. If we assume that we are able to get emission-line redshifts from hosts with $R < 25$ mags \citep{Kruhler2012}, then we would have missed around 30\% (8 out of 26 from the sample of \citealt{Berger2014} with measured $L_B/L^{\star}_{B}$), if they were at the redshift of GRB~111117A. If we assume that the hosts missing redshift in \citet{Berger2014} follow the redshift distribution of the hosts \textit{with} redshift, this implies that we are \textit{not} missing a dominant fraction of sGRB redshift at $z \approx 2$, due to host faintness. 

The theoretical redshift distribution of sGRBs depends on the type of delay-time function used to model the progenitor system. The redshift of GRB~111117A puts constraints on the type of delay-time models suitable for modeling. The likelihood preferred lognormal time delay models investigated in \citet{Wanderman2015} predicts a rate of sGRBs at $z = 2.211$, $\sim$ 2 orders of magnitude lower compared to peak rate (z = 0.9). It is stated in \citet{Wanderman2015} that this preference depends critically on the absence of non-collapsar sGRB at $z \gtrsim 1.2$. The redshift of the burst, on the other hand, is close to the expected peak in sGRB rate calculated for the power law models \citep{Behroozi2014, Wanderman2015}. 



%In terms of Fig. 9 in \citet{Fong2013a}, the host is indeed  brighter than the average galaxies using the evolving luminosity function of galaxies. \todo{What is the average brightness of a galaxy at z = 2?} 
%\todo{Reformulate paragraph}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Constraints on the progenitor separation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

At $z = 2.211$, the age of the universe is 2.97 Gyr. If the progenitor systems of sGRBs are the merger of two neutron stars, this sets a hard upper limit to the coalescence timescale for such a system. In the absence of other mechanisms, the timescale of the orbital decay of the system is set by the energy loss due to gravitational waves, which in turn is set by the mass of constituent compact objects and the separation of the two \citep{Postnov2014}. If we assume that the formation timescale of the first galaxies is short compared to the time since the big bang \citep{Richard2011} and if we assume a mass of 1.4 M$_\odot$ for each of the neutron stars at the time of system formation, this places a limit on the initial separation of the two neutron stars of a$_0 < 3.2 $R$_\odot$, where a$_0$ is the initial separation. 
Assuming our measured age of the stellar population ($\tau = 0.5$ Gyr) as a limit for the orbital decay time we can put a tighter constraint of a$_0 < 2.1 $R$_\odot$. However, this does not account for the possibility there could be an underlying stellar population of older stars from a previous star-formation epoch, which is why we consider a$_0 < 3.2 $R$_\odot$ as a hard upper limit. The delay time between formation and explosion is well accomodated by the models of \citet{Belczynski2006}, although the longest formation channels are excluded. This is especially true given the late type nature of the host \citep{OShaughnessy2008}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We have in this letter provided a revised, spectroscopic redshift for GRB~111117A based on emission lines discovered using an improved reduction scheme, setting it at $z = 2.211$. This value supersedes the previous photometric redshift of $z \sim 1.3$ \citep{Margutti2012, Sakamoto2013}. Part of the reason for the erroneous redshift estimate of previous authors is attributed to a discrepancy in the measured $z$-band magnitude. 

The rest-frame parameters of the burst and the conditions of the burst environment have been recalculated using the new distance. The X-ray derived hydrogen column density towards GRB~111117A is the highest within a complete sample of short hosts, but seems to trace the evolution with redshift as found for the hosts of long GRBs. 

The SFR of the host is in the upper end of the sGRB host SFR distribution and this plays a role in allowing a redshift to be measured for this host. Despite the moderate age and high $N_H$, almost no dust is present.

Although a single burst carries little leverage in terms of constraining the redshift distribution of sGRB, the high redshift of GRB~111117A needs to be accommodated. A lognormal delay time model predicts a very low volumetric density of bursts at $z = 2.211$, whereas a power law delay time model peaks near GRB~111117A. If more sGRBs are at this redshift, but missed due to faintness of their hosts, a lognormal delay time model will be disfavored. Compared to a sample of short hosts, GRB~111117A is more luminous than 70 per cent of the sample with measured luminosities. Of the host sample, for 30 per cent, we would be unable to determine a redshift, should they be at the redshift of GRB~111117A. This implies that we are \textit{not} missing a dominant fraction of the sGRBs at $z \sim 2$.

Using the age of the universe at the time of explosion allows us to set constraints on the maximal separation between the engine constituents at the time of formation. We find that the maximal separation for two neutron stars at formation time is a$_0 < 3.2 $R$_\odot$, which excludes some of the formation channels with the longest timescales. 

We make all the data, code and calculation related to the paper along with the paper itself available at \url{https://github.com/jselsing/GRB111117A}.
