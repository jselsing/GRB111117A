abstract = {The detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves heralds the age of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. On 17 August 2017 the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed GW170817, a strong signal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system. Less than 2 seconds after the merger, a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region of the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the gravitational-wave source. This sky region was subsequently observed by optical astronomy facilities, resulting in the identification of an optical transient signal within {\$}\backslashsim 10{\$} arcsec of the galaxy NGC 4993. These multi-messenger observations allow us to use GW170817 as a standard siren, the gravitational-wave analog of an astronomical standard candle, to measure the Hubble constant. This quantity, which represents the local expansion rate of the Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental importance to cosmology. Our measurement combines the distance to the source inferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity inferred from measurements of the redshift using electromagnetic data. This approach does not require any form of cosmic "distance ladder;" the gravitational wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance out to cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomical distance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be {\$}70.0{\^{}}{\{}+12.0{\}}{\_}{\{}-8.0{\}} \backslash, \backslashmathrm{\{}km{\}} \backslash, \backslashmathrm{\{}s{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} \backslash, \backslashmathrm{\{}Mpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} (maximum a posteriori and 68{\%} credible interval). This is consistent with existing measurements, while being completely independent of them. Additional standard-siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will provide precision constraints of this important cosmological parameter.},

abstract = {On 2017 August 17, the gravitational-wave event GW170817 was observed by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 170817A was observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and the Anticoincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory. The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal and spatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by chance is {\$}5.0\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-8{\}}{\$}. We therefore confirm binary neutron star mergers as a progenitor of short GRBs. The association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides new insight into fundamental physics and the origin of short gamma-ray bursts. We use the observed time delay of {\$}(+1.74 \backslashpm 0.05)\backslash,{\$}s between GRB 170817A and GW170817 to: (i) constrain the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light to be between {\$}-3\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-15{\}}{\$} and {\$}+7\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-16{\}}{\$} times the speed of light, (ii) place new bounds on the violation of Lorentz invariance, (iii) present a new test of the equivalence principle by constraining the Shapiro delay between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. We also use the time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz factor of the region emitting the gamma rays. GRB 170817A is the closest short GRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude less energetic than other bursts with measured redshift. A new generation of gamma-ray detectors, and subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be essential to detect similar short bursts at greater distances. Finally, we predict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1--1.4 per year during the 2018-2019 observing run and 0.3--1.7 per year at design sensitivity.},

abstract = {We present observations and analysis of the host galaxies of 23 heavily dust-obscured gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the Swift satellite between the years 2005-2009, a sample representing all GRBs during this period with an unambiguous host-frame extinction of at least A{\_}V{\textgreater}1 mag. Deep observations with Keck, Gemini, VLT, HST, and Spitzer successfully detect the host galaxies and establish redshifts for all 23 events, enabling us to provide measurements of the host stellar masses, star-formation rates (SFRs), and mean extinctions. Compared to the hosts of unobscured GRBs at similar redshifts, we find that the hosts of dust-obscured GRBs are (on average) more massive by about an order of magnitude and are also significantly more rapidly star-forming and more dust-obscured. However, while the inclusion of this population of dust-obscured hosts shows that GRBs populate all types of star-forming galaxies including the most massive, luminous systems at z{\~{}}2, at redshifts below z{\textless}1.5 the overall GRB population continues to show a highly significant aversion away from massive galaxies and a corresponding preference for low-mass systems relative to would be expected given a purely SFR-selected galaxy sample. This supports the notion that the GRB rate is strongly dependent on metallicity, and may suggest that the most massive galaxies in the universe underwent an significant transition in their chemical properties approximately 9 Gyr ago. We also conclude that, based on the absence of unobscured GRBs in massive galaxies and the absence of obscured GRBs in low-mass galaxies, the dust distributions of both the lowest-mass and the highest-mass galaxies are relatively homogeneous, while intermediate-mass galaxies ({\~{}}10{\^{}}9 M{\_}sun) have much more diverse internal dust properties.},

abstract = {The largest natural source of light at night is theMoon, and it is the major contributor to the astronomical sky background. Being able to accurately predict the sky background, including scattered moonlight is important for scheduling astronomical observations. We have developed an improved scattered moonlight model, in which the components are computed with a better physical understanding as opposed to the simple empirical fit in the frequently used photometricmodel ofKrisciunas{\&}Schaefer (1991, PASP, 103, 1033).Our spectroscopic model can better trace the spectral trends of scattered moonlight for any position of the Moon and target observation. This is the first scattered moonlight model that we know of which is this physical and versatile. We have incorporated an observed solar spectrum, accurate lunar albedo fit, and elaborate scattering and absorption calculations that include scattering off of molecules and aerosols. It was designed for Cerro Paranal, but can be modified for any location with known atmospheric properties. Throughout the optical range, the uncertainty is less than 20{\%}. This advanced scattered moonlight model can predict the amount of scattered moonlight for any given geometry of the Moon and target, and lunar phase for the entire optical spectrum. Key},

abstract = {The main astronomical source of r-process elements has not yet been identified. One plausible site is neutron star mergers (NSMs), but from perspective of the Galactic chemical evolution, it has been pointed out that NSMs cannot reproduce the observed r-process abundance distribution of metal-poor stars at [Fe/H] {\$}{\textless} -3{\$}. Recently, Tsujimoto {\&} Shigeyama (2014) pointed out that NSM ejecta can spread into much larger volume than ejecta from a supernova. We re-examine the enrichment of r-process elements by NSMs considering this difference in propagation using the chemical evolution model under the hierarchical galaxy formation. The observed r-process enhanced stars around [Fe/H] {\$}\backslashsim -3{\$} are reproduced if the star formation efficiency is lower for low-mass galaxies under a realistic delay time distribution for NSMs. We show that a significant fraction of NSM ejecta escape from its host proto-galaxy to pollute intergalactic matter and other proto-galaxies. The propagation of r-process elements over proto-galaxies changes the abundance distribution at [Fe/H] {\$}{\textless} -3{\$} and obtains distribution compatible with observations of the Milky Way halo stars. In particular, the pre-enrichment of intergalactic medium explains the observed scarcity of EMP stars without Ba and abundance distribution of r-process elements at [Fe/H] {\$}\backslashlesssim -3.5{\$}.},

abstract = {We present a carefully selected sample of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) observed by the Swift satellite up to June 2013. Inspired by the criteria we used to build a similar sample of bright long GRBs (the BAT6 sample), we selected SGRBs with favorable observing conditions for the redshift determination on ground, ending up with a sample of 36 events, almost half of which with a redshift measure. The redshift completeness increases up to about 70{\%} (with an average redshift value of z = 0.85) by restricting to those events that are bright in the 15-150 keV Swift Burst Alert Telescope energy band. Such flux-limited sample minimizes any redshift-related selection effects, and can provide a robust base for the study of the energetics, redshift distribution and environment of the Swift bright population of SGRBs. For all the events of the sample we derived the prompt and afterglow emission in both the observer and (when possible) rest frame and tested the consistency with the correlations valid for long GRBs. The redshift and intrinsic X-ray absorbing column density distributions we obtain are consistent with the scenario of SGRBs originated by the coalescence of compact objects in primordial binaries, with a possible minor contribution ({\~{}}10{\%}-25{\%}) of binaries formed by dynamical capture (or experiencing large natal kicks). This sample is expected to significantly increase with further years of Swift activity.},

abstract = {Context. The afterglows and host galaxies of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer unique opportunities to study star-forming galaxies in the high-z Universe. Until recently, however, the information inferred from GRB follow-up observations was mostly limited to optically bright afterglows, biasing all demographic studies against sight-lines that contain large amounts of dust. Aims: Here we present afterglow and host observations for a sample of bursts that are exemplary of previously missed ones because of high visual extinction (A{\_}{\{}V{\}}{\^{}}{\{}GRB{\}} {\{}$\backslash$gsim{\}} 1 mag) along the sight-line. This facilitates an investigation of the properties, geometry, and location of the absorbing dust of these poorly-explored host galaxies, and a comparison to hosts from optically-selected samples. Methods: This work is based on GROND optical/NIR and Swift/XRT X-ray observations of the afterglows, and multi-color imaging for eight GRB hosts. The afterglow and galaxy spectral energy distributions yield detailed insight into physical properties such as the dust and metal content along the GRB sight-line and galaxy-integrated characteristics such as the host's stellar mass, luminosity, color-excess, and star-formation rate. Results: For the eight afterglows considered in this study, we report for the first time the redshift of GRB 081109 (z = 0.9787 {\{}$\backslash$plusmn{\}} 0.0005), and the visual extinction towards GRBs 081109 (A{\_}{\{}V{\}}{\^{}}{\{}GRB{\}} = 3.4{\_}{\{}-0.3{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.4{\}} mag) and 100621A (A{\_}{\{}V{\}}{\^{}}{\{}GRB{\}} = 3.8{\{}$\backslash$plusmn{\}}0.2 mag), which are among the largest ever derived for GRB afterglows. Combined with non-extinguished GRBs, there is a strong anti-correlation between the afterglow's metal-to-dust ratio and visual extinction. The hosts of the dustiest afterglows are diverse in their properties, but on average redder ({\{}$\backslash$mlab{\}} (R - K){\_}{\{}AB{\}} {\{}$\backslash$mrab{\}} {\~{}} 1.6 mag), more luminous ({\{}$\backslash$mlab{\}} L {\{}$\backslash$mrab{\}} {\~{}} 0.9 L{\^{}}{\{}∗{\}}), and massive ({\{}$\backslash$mlab{\}} log M{\_}{\{}∗{\}} [M{\_}{\{}⊙{\}}] {\{}$\backslash$mrab{\}} {\~{}} 9.8) than the hosts of optically-bright events. Hence, we probe a different galaxy population, suggesting that previous host samples miss most of the massive and metal-rich members. This also indicates that the dust along the sight-line is often related to host properties, and thus probably located in the diffuse ISM or interstellar clouds and not in the immediate GRB environment. Some of the hosts in our sample, are blue, young, or of low stellar mass illustrating that even apparently non-extinguished galaxies possess very dusty sight-lines owing to a patchy dust distribution. Conclusions: The afterglows and host galaxies of the dustiest GRBs provide evidence of a complex dust geometry in star-forming galaxies. In addition, they establish a population of luminous, massive, and correspondingly chemically evolved GRB hosts. This suggests that GRBs trace the global star-formation rate better than studies based on optically selected host samples indicate, and that the previously claimed deficiency of high-mass hosts was at least partially a selection effect. Based on observations made with GROND at the MPI/ESO 2.2 m telescope and with telescopes at the European Southern Observatory at LaSilla/Paranal, Chile under program 086.A-0533 and obtained from the ESO/ST-ECF Science Archive Facility from programs 177.A-0591 and 078.D-0416.},

abstract = {The cosmic evolution of the neutron-star merger (NSM) rate can be deduced from the observed cosmic star formation rate. This allows us to estimate the rate expected in the horizon of the gravitational wave detectors advanced Virgo and advanced LIGO and to compare those rates with independent predictions. In this context, the rapid neutron-capture process, or r-process, can be used as a constraint assuming NSM is the main astrophysical site for this nucleosynthetic process. We compute the early cosmic evolution of a typical r-process element, europium. Eu yields from NSM are taken from recent nucleosynthesis calculations. The same approach allows us to compute the cosmic rate of Core-Collapse SuperNovae (CCSNe) and the associated evolution of Eu. We find that the bulk of Eu observations at [Fe/H] {\textgreater} −2.5 can be rather well fitted by either CCSN or NSM scenarios. However, at lower metallicity, the early Eu cosmic evolution favours NSM as the main astrophysical site for the r-process. A comparison between our calculations and spectroscopic observations at very low metallicities allows us to constrain the coalescence time-scale in the NSM scenario to ∼0.1–0.2 Gyr. These values are in agreement with the coalescence time-scales of some observed binary pulsars. Finally, the cosmic evolution of Eu is used to put constraints on (i) the NSM rate, (ii) the merger rate in the horizon of the gravitational wave detectors advanced Virgo/ad LIGO, as well as (iii) the expected rate of electromagnetic counterparts to mergers ('kilonovae') in large near-infrared surveys.},

@article{Schady2010,
abstract = {In this paper we present the results from the analysis of a sample of 28 gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow spectral energy distributions, spanning the X-ray through to near-infrared wavelengths. This is the largest sample of GRB afterglow spectral energy distributions thus far studied, providing a strong handle on the optical depth distribution of soft X-ray absorption and dust-extinction systems in GRB host galaxies. We detect an absorption system within the GRB host galaxy in 79 per cent of the sample, and an extinction system in 71 per cent of the sample, and find the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction law to provide an acceptable fit to the host galaxy extinction profile for the majority of cases, consistent with previous findings. The range in the soft X-ray absorption to dust-extinction ratio, NH,X/AV, in GRB host galaxies spans almost two orders of magnitude, and the typical ratios are significantly larger than those of the Magellanic Clouds or Milky Way. Although dust destruction could be a cause, at least in part, for the large NH,X/AV ratios, the good fit provided by the SMC extinction law for the majority of our sample suggests that there is an abundance of small dust grains in the GRB environment, which we would expect to have been destroyed if dust destruction were responsible for the large NH,X/AV ratios. Instead, our analysis suggests that the distribution of NH,X/AV in GRB host galaxies may be mostly intrinsic to these galaxies, and this is further substantiated by evidence for a strong negative correlation between NH,X/AV and metallicity for a subsample of GRB hosts with known metallicity.},

We show that both distributions are compatible with the assumption that short as well as long bursts follow the star formation rate. In this case the difference between the two observed distributions can be interpreted as arising mostly from differences in the detector's sensitivity to long and short bursts, while the local rate of short bursts is 0.1{\~{}}h703 Gpc-3 yr-1. We also consider the possibility that short GRBs may be associated with binary neutron star mergers and estimate the effect of the merging time delay on the luminosity function and redshift distribution.

@article{Norris2006,
abstract = {The recent association of several short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with early-type galaxies with low star formation rates demonstrates that short bursts arise from a different progenitor mechanism than long bursts. However, since the duration distributions of the two classes overlap, membership is not always easily established. The picture is complicated by occasional softer, extended emission lasting tens of seconds after the initial spikelike emission comprising an otherwise short burst. Using the large BATSE sample with time-tagged event (TTE) data, we show that the fundamental defining characteristic of the short-burst class is that the initial spike exhibits negligible spectral evolution at energies above {\~{}}25 keV. The behavior is nearly ubiquitous for the 260 bursts with T90{\textless}2 s for which the BATSE TTE data type completely included the initial spike. We find this same signature-negligible spectral lag-for six Swift BAT short bursts and one HETE-2 short burst. We also analyze a small sample of ``short'' BATSE bursts-those with the most fluent, intense extended emission. The same lack of evolution on the pulse timescale obtains for the extended emission in the brighter bursts for which significant measurements can be made. We also show that the dynamic range in the ratio of peak intensities, spike:extended, is {\~{}}104. However, for our BATSE sample the total counts fluence of the extended component equals or exceeds that in the spike by a factor of several. A high Lorentz factor, {\~{}}500-1000, might explain the negligible lags.},

abstract = {We detect the optical afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 070714B. Our observations of the afterglow show an initial plateau in the light curve for approximately the first 5-25 minutes, and then steepening to a power-law decay with index $\alpha$ = 0.86 ± 0.10 for the period between 1 and 24 hr postburst. This is consistent with the X-ray light curve which shows an initial plateau followed by a similar subsequent decay. At late time, we detect a host galaxy at the location of the optical transient. Gemini Nod {\&} Shuffle spectroscopic observations of the host show a single emission line at 7167 {\AA} which, based on a griz JHK photometric redshift, we conclude is the 3727 {\AA} [O II] line. We therefore find a redshift of z = 0.923. This redshift, as well as a subsequent probable spectroscopic redshift determination of GRB 070429B at z = 0.904 by two other groups significantly exceeds the previous highest spectroscopically confirmed short burst redshift of z = 0.546 for GRB 051221. This dramatically moves back the time at which we know short bursts were being formed and suggests that the present evidence for an old progenitor population may be observationally biased.},

abstract = {We study the distribution of long gamma-ray bursts in the Epeak-Eiso and in the Eobspeak-fluence planes through an updated sample of 76 bursts, with measured redshift and spectral parameters, detected up to 2007 September. We confirm the existence of a strong rest-frame correlation Epeak {\~{}} E0.54+/-0.01iso. Contrary to previous studies, no sign of evolution with redshift of the Epeak-Eiso correlation (either its slope and its normalization) is found. The 76 bursts define a strong Eobspeak-fluence correlation in the observer frame (Eobspeak {\~{}} F0.32+/-0.05bol) with redshifts evenly distributed along this correlation. We study possible instrumental selection effects in the observer frame Eobspeak-fluence plane. In particular, we concentrate on the minimum peak flux necessary to trigger a given gamma-ray burst (GRB) detector (trigger threshold) and the minimum fluence a burst must have to determine the value of Eobspeak (spectral analysis threshold). We find that the latter dominates in the Eobspeak-fluence plane over the former. Our analysis shows, however, that these instrumental selection effects do not dominate for bursts detected before the launch of the Swift satellite, while the spectral analysis threshold is the dominant truncation effect of the Swift GRB sample (27 out of 76 events). This suggests that the Eobspeak-fluence correlation defined by the pre-Swift sample could be affected by other, still not understood, selection effects. Besides, we caution about the conclusions on the existence of the Eobspeak-fluence correlation based on our Swift sample alone.},

abstract = {We quantify the stellar abundances of neutron-rich r-process nuclei in cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environments project. The galaxy is enriched with r-process elements by binary neutron star (NS) mergers and with iron and other metals by supernovae. These calculations include key hydrodynamic mixing processes not present in standard semi-analytic chemical evolution models, such as galactic winds and hydrodynamic flows associated with structure formation. We explore a range of models for the rate and delay time of NS mergers, intended to roughly bracket the wide range of models consistent with current observational constraints. We show that NS mergers can produce [r-process/Fe] abundance ratios and scatter that appear reasonably consistent with observational constraints. At low metallicity, [Fe/H]{\textless}-2, we predict there is a wide range of stellar r-process abundance ratios, with both supersolar and subsolar abundances. Low-metallicity stars or stars that are outliers in their r-process abundance ratios are, on average, formed at high redshift and located at large galactocentric radius. Because NS mergers are rare, our results are not fully converged with respect to resolution, particularly at low metallicity. However, the uncertain rate and delay time distribution of NS mergers introduces an uncertainty in the r-process abundances comparable to that due to finite numerical resolution. Overall, our results are consistent with NS mergers being the source of most of the r-process nuclei in the Universe.},

abstract = {Context. Short duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are thought to be related to the violent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, which makes them promising sources of gravitational waves. The detection of a "kilonova"-likesignature associated to the Swift-detected GRB 130603B has suggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. Aims: Our knowledge on SGRB has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernova signatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always be securely associated. Further progress has been significantly hampered by the faintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), which has so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. Afterglow spectroscopy is the key tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced, crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. Methods: Here we present the first spectra of a prototypical SGRB afterglow in which both absorption and emission features are clearly detected. Together with multi-wavelength photometry we study the host and environment of GRB 130603B. Results: From these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z = 0.3565 ± 0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and a substantial line of sight extinction of AV = 0.86 ± 0.15 mag. The GRB was located at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy with near-solar metallicity. Unlike for most long GRBs (LGRBs), NHX/AV is consistent with the Galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differs from those found in LGRBs. Conclusions: The merger is not associated with the most star-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region, implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact object binary.

abstract = {We present an optical flux versus X-ray flux diagram for all known gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) for which an X-ray afterglow has been detected. We propose an operational definition of dark bursts as those bursts that are optically subluminous with respect to the fireball model, i.e., that have an optical--to--X-ray spectral index beta{\_}ox {\textless} 0.5. Out of a sample of 52 GRBs, we identify five dark bursts. The definition and diagram serve as a simple and quick diagnostic tool for identifying dark GRBs based on limited information, particularly useful for early and objective identification of dark GRBs observed with the Swift satellite.},

abstract = {We present detailed observations of the bright short-hard gamma-ray burst GRB 090510 made with the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi observatory. GRB 090510 is the first burst detected by the LAT that shows strong evidence for a deviation from a Band spectral fitting function during the prompt emission phase. The time-integrated spectrum is fit by the sum of a Band function with {\$}\backslashEpeak = 3.9\backslashpm 0.3{\$}$\backslash$,MeV, which is the highest yet measured, and a hard power-law component with photon index {\$}-1.62\backslashpm 0.03{\$} that dominates the emission below {\$}\backslashapprox{\$}$\backslash$,20$\backslash$,keV and above {\$}\backslashapprox{\$}$\backslash$,100$\backslash$,MeV. The onset of the high-energy spectral component appears to be delayed by {\$}\backslashsim{\$}$\backslash$,0.1$\backslash$,s with respect to the onset of a component well fit with a single Band function. A faint GBM pulse and a LAT photon are detected 0.5$\backslash$,s before the main pulse. During the prompt phase, the LAT detected a photon with energy {\$}30.5{\^{}}{\{}+5.8{\}}{\_}{\{}-2.6{\}}{\$} GeV, the highest ever measured from a short GRB. Observation of this photon sets a minimum bulk outflow Lorentz factor, {\$}\backslashGamma\backslashga{\$}$\backslash$,1200, using simple {\$}\backslashgamma\backslashgamma{\$} opacity arguments for this GRB at redshift {\$}z = 0.903{\$} and a variability time scale on the order of tens of ms for the {\$}\backslashapprox{\$}$\backslash$,100$\backslash$,keV--few MeV flux. Stricter high confidence estimates imply {\$}\backslashGamma \backslashga 1000{\$} and still require that the outflows powering short GRBs are at least as highly relativistic as those of long duration GRBs. Implications of the temporal behavior and power-law shape of the additional component on synchrotron/synchrotron self-Compton (SSC), external-shock synchrotron, and hadronic models are considered.},

abstract = {Although the rapid neutron-capture process, or r-process, is fundamentally important for explaining the origin of approximately half of the stable nuclei with A {\textgreater} 60, the astrophysical site of this process has not been identified yet. Here we study r-process nucleosynthesis in material that is dynamically ejected by tidal and pressure forces during the merging of binary neutron stars (NSs) and within milliseconds afterwards. For the first time we make use of relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of such events, defining consistently the conditions that determine the nucleosynthesis, i.e., neutron enrichment, entropy, early density evolution and thus expansion timescale, and ejecta mass. We find that 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}} solar masses are ejected, which is enough for mergers to be the main source of heavy (A {\textgreater} 140) galactic r-nuclei for merger rates of some 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}} per year. While asymmetric mergers eject 2-3 times more mass than symmetric ones, the exact amount depends weakly on whether the NSs have radii of {\~{}}15 km for a "stiff" nuclear equation of state (EOS) or {\~{}}12 km for a "soft" EOS. R-process nucleosynthesis during the decompression becomes largely insensitive to the detailed conditions because of efficient fission recycling, producing a composition that closely follows the solar r-abundance distribution for nuclei with mass numbers A {\textgreater} 140. Estimating the light curve powered by the radioactive decay heating of r-process nuclei with an approximative model, we expect high emission in the B-V-R bands for 1-2 days with potentially observable longer duration in the case of asymmetric mergers because of the larger ejecta mass.},

abstract = {Short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are intense flashes of cosmic gamma-rays, lasting less than {\~{}}2 s, whose origin is one of the great unsolved questions of astrophysics today. While the favoured hypothesis for their production, a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact stellar objects (specifically, two neutron stars, NS-NS, or a neutron star and a black hole, NS-BH), is supported by indirect evidence such as their host galaxy properties, unambiguous confirmation of the model is still lacking. Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient in the days following the burst, a so-called "kilonova". Indeed, it is speculated that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe. Recent calculations suggest much of the kilonova energy should appear in the near-infrared (nIR) due to the high optical opacity created by these heavy r-process elements. Here we report strong evidence for such an event accompanying SGRB 130603B. If this simplest interpretation of the data is correct, it provides (i) support for the compact object merger hypothesis of SGRBs, (ii) confirmation that such mergers are likely sites of significant r-process production and (iii) quite possibly an alternative, un-beamed electromagnetic signature of the most promising sources for direct detection of gravitational waves.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, our physical understanding of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has progressed rapidly, thanks to the discovery and observation of their long-lived afterglow emission. Long-duration ({\textgreater} 2 s) GRBs are associated with the explosive deaths of massive stars ('collapsars', ref. 1), which produce accompanying supernovae; the short-duration ({\textless} or = 2 s) GRBs have a different origin, which has been argued to be the merger of two compact objects. Here we report optical observations of GRB 060614 (duration approximately 100 s, ref. 10) that rule out the presence of an associated supernova. This would seem to require a new explosive process: either a massive collapsar that powers a GRB without any associated supernova, or a new type of 'engine', as long-lived as the collapsar but without a massive star. We also show that the properties of the host galaxy (redshift z = 0.125) distinguish it from other long-duration GRB hosts and suggest that an entirely new type of GRB progenitor may be required.},

abstract = {We present the rest-frame optical ( B , V , and R band) luminosity functions (LFs) of galaxies at 2 ≤ z ≤ 3.5, measured from a K -selected sample constructed from the deep NIR MUSYC, the ultradeep FIRES, and the GOODS-CDFS. This sample is unique for its combination of area and range of luminosities. The faint-end slopes of the LFs at z {\textgreater} 2 are consistent with those at z {\~{}} 0. The characteristic magnitudes are significantly brighter than the local values (e.g., {\~{}}1.2 mag in the R band), while the measured values for $\Phi$ {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {\{}sstarf{\}} are typically {\~{}}5 times smaller. The B -band luminosity density at z {\~{}} 2.3 is similar to the local value, and in the R band it is {\~{}}2 times smaller than the local value. We present the LF of distant red galaxies (DRGs), which we compare to that of non-DRGs. While DRGs and non-DRGs are characterized by similar LFs at the bright end, the faint-end slope of the non-DRG LF is much steeper than that of DRGs. The contribution of DRGs to the global densities down to the faintest probed luminosities is 14{\%}-25{\%} in number and 22{\%}-33{\%} in luminosity. From the derived rest-frame U - V colors and stellar population synthesis models, we estimate the mass-to-light ratios ( M / L ) of the different subsamples. The M / L ratios of DRGs are {\~{}}5 times higher (in the R and V bands) than those of non-DRGs. The global stellar mass density at 2 ≤ z ≤ 3.5 appears to be dominated by DRGs, whose contribution is of order {\~{}}60{\%}-80{\%} of the global value. Qualitatively similar results are obtained when the population is split by rest-frame U - V color instead of observed J - K color.},

abstract = {The source of the gravitational-wave signal GW170817, very likely a binary neutron star merger, was also observed electromagnetically, providing the first multi-messenger observations of this type. The two week long electromagnetic counterpart had a signature indicative of an r-process-induced optical transient known as a kilonova. This Letter examines how the mass of the dynamical ejecta can be estimated without a direct electromagnetic observation of the kilonova, using gravitational-wave measurements and a phenomenological model calibrated to numerical simulations of mergers with dynamical ejecta. Specifically, we apply the model to the binary masses inferred from the gravitational-wave measurements, and use the resulting mass of the dynamical ejecta to estimate its contribution (without the effects of wind ejecta) to the corresponding kilonova light curves from various models. The distributions of dynamical ejecta mass range between {\$}M{\_}{\{}ej{\}} = 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} - 10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} for various equations of state, assuming the neutron stars are rotating slowly. In addition, we use our estimates of the dynamical ejecta mass and the neutron star merger rates inferred from GW170817 to constrain the contribution of events like this to the r-process element abundance in the Galaxy when ejecta mass from post-merger winds is neglected. We find that if {\$}\backslashgtrsim10\backslash{\%}{\$} of the matter dynamically ejected from BNS mergers is converted to r-process elements, GW170817-like BNS mergers could fully account for the amount of r-process material observed in the Milky Way.},

abstract = {Aims: With an observed and rest-frame duration of {\textless}2 s and {\textless}0.5 s,$\backslash$nrespectively, GRB 090426 could be classified as a short GRB. The prompt$\backslash$ndetection, both from space and ground-based telescopes, of a bright$\backslash$noptical counterpart to this GRB offered a unique opportunity to complete$\backslash$na detailed study. Methods: Based on an extensive$\backslash$nground-based observational campaign, we obtained the spectrum of the$\backslash$noptical afterglow of GRB 090426, measuring its redshift and obtaining$\backslash$ninformation about the medium in which the event took place. We completed$\backslash$nfollow-up observations of the afterglow optical light curve down to the$\backslash$nbrightness level of the host galaxy that we firmly identified and$\backslash$nstudied. We also retrieved and analyzed all the available high-energy$\backslash$ndata of this event, and compared the results with our findings in the$\backslash$noptical. This represents one of the most detailed studies of a$\backslash$nshort-duration event presented so far. Results: The time$\backslash$nproperties qualify GRB 090426 as a short burst. In this case, its$\backslash$nredshift of z = 2.61 would be the highest yet found for a GRB of this$\backslash$nclass. On the other hand, the spectral and energy properties are more$\backslash$nsimilar to those of long bursts. LBT late-time deep imaging identifies a$\backslash$nstar-forming galaxy at a redshift consistent with that of the GRB. The$\backslash$nafterglow lies within the light of its host and shows evidence of local$\backslash$nabsorption. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe results reported in this paper are based on $\backslash$n$\backslash$nobservations carried out at Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and at Large$\backslash$nBinocular Telescope. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nTables 1, 2 and Figs.

abstract = {An important constraint for galaxy evolution models is how much gas resides in galaxies, in particular at the peak of star formation z=1-3. We attempt a novel approach by letting long-duration Gamma Ray Bursts (LGRBs) x-ray their host galaxies and deliver column densities to us. This requires a good understanding of the obscurer and biases introduced by incomplete follow-up observations. We analyse the X-ray afterglow of all 844 Swift LGRBs to date for their column density {\$}N{\_}H{\$}. To derive the population properties we propagate all uncertainties in a consistent Bayesian methodology. The {\$}N{\_}H{\$} distribution covers the {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}20-23{\}}\backslashmathrm{\{}cm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} range and shows no evolutionary effect. Higher obscurations, e.g. Compton-thick columns, could have been detected but are not observed. The {\$}N{\_}H{\$} distribution is consistent with sources randomly populating a ellipsoidal gas cloud of major axis {\$}N{\_}H{\^{}}\backslashtext{\{}major{\}}=10{\^{}}{\{}23{\}}\backslashmathrm{\{}cm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} with 0.22 dex intrinsic scatter between objects. The unbiased SHOALS survey of afterglows and hosts allows us to constrain the relation between Spitzer-derived stellar masses and X-ray derived column densities {\$}N{\_}H{\$}. We find a well-constrained powerlaw relation of {\$}N{\_}H=10{\^{}}{\{}21.7{\}}\backslashmathrm{\{}cm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}\backslashtimes\backslashleft(M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}/10{\^{}}{\{}9.5{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}\backslashright){\^{}}{\{}1/3{\}}{\$}, with 0.5 dex intrinsic scatter between objects. The Milky Way and the Magellanic clouds also follow this relation. From the geometry of the obscurer, its stellar mass dependence and comparison with local galaxies we conclude that LGRBs are primarily obscured by galaxy-scale gas. Ray tracing of simulated Illustris galaxies reveals a relation of the same normalisation, but a steeper stellar-mass dependence and mild redshift evolution. Our new approach provides valuable insight into the gas residing in high-redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {A significant proportion ({\$}\backslashsim30\backslash{\%}{\$}) of the short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) localised by Swift have no detected host galaxy coincident with the burst location to deep limits, and also no high-likelihood association with proximate galaxies on the sky. These SGRBs may represent a population at moderately high redshifts ({\$}z\backslashgtrsim1{\$}), for which the hosts are faint, or a population where the progenitor has been kicked far from its host or is sited in an outlying globular cluster. We consider the afterglow and host observations of three 'hostless' bursts (GRBs 090305A, 091109B and 111020A), coupled with a new observational diagnostic to aid the association of SGRBs with putative host galaxies to investigate this issue. Considering the well localised SGRB sample, 7/25 SGRBs can be classified as 'hostless' by our diagnostic. Statistically, however, the proximity of these seven SGRBs to nearby galaxies is higher than is seen for random positions on the sky. This suggests that the majority of 'hostless' SGRBs have likely been kicked from proximate galaxies at moderate redshift. Though this result still suggests only a small proportion of SGRBs will be within the AdLIGO horizon for NS-NS or NS-BH inspiral detection ({\$}z\backslashsim0.1{\$}), in the particular case of GRB 111020A a plausible host candidate is at {\$}z=0.02{\$}.},

The star formation rate in the model is regulated through ionization of the interstellar hydrogen by massive O,B stars. The volume of a galaxy is determined by the condition of equilibrium between collisional dissipation of turbulent energy of interstellar gas and turbulisation of the gas by supernovae. The modern theory of stellar evolution helps to describe evolution of the stellar component of a galaxy in time and to estimate the current frequency of supernovae. This model reproduces some basic observed parameters of spherical and disk galaxies and their evolution on the Hubble timescale. The role of external factors in evolution of galaxies and possible reasons of a nonstationary star formation in galaxies and their nuclei are shortly discussed.},

abstract = {The elements heavier than zinc are synthesized through the (r)apid and (s)low neutron-capture processes. The primary astrophysical production site of the r-process elements (such as europium) has been debated for nearly 60 years. Chemical abundance trends of old Galactic halo stars initially suggested continual r-process production from sources like core-collapse supernovae, but evidence in the local universe favored r-process production primarily from rare events like neutron star mergers. The appearance of a europium abundance plateau in some dwarf spheroidal galaxies was suggested as evidence for rare r-process enrichment in the early universe, but only under the assumption of no gas accretion into the dwarfs. Invoking cosmologically motivated gas accretion actually favors continual r-process enrichment in those systems. Furthermore, the universal r-process pattern has not been cleanly identified in those galaxies. The smaller, chemically simpler, and more ancient ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) assembled shortly after the formation of the first stars and are ideal systems to study nucleosynthesis processes such as the r-process. Here we report that seven of nine stars observed with high-resolution spectroscopy in the recently discovered UFD Reticulum II show strong enhancements in heavy neutron-capture elements with abundances that exactly follow the universal r-process pattern above barium. The enhancement in this "r-process galaxy" is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than what is seen in any other UFD. This implies that a single rare event produced the r-process material in Reticulum II, whether or not gas accretion was significant in UFDs. The r-process yield is incompatible with ordinary core-collapse supernova yields but consistent with r-process production in neutron star mergers.},

abstract = {We have studied X-ray halos around 25 point sources and four supernova remnants using ROSAT observations. All sources were observed during the ROSAT all-sky survey, 8 point-like sources and 2 supernovae remnants have been studied additionally using ROSAT pointed observations. The shapes of the X-ray halos were fitted with commonly used dust models (e.g., the Mathis-Rumpl-Nordsiek grain size distribution), resulting in a determination of the fractional halo intensity, which in turn can be converted into a dust column density. From the simultaneously obtained X-ray spectra, the cold gas absorption and hence an equivalent hydrogen column was determined. A surprisingly good correlation exists between the simultaneously measured dust and hydrogen column densities,$\backslash$nindicating that gas and dust must be to a large extent cospatial. For the X-ray sources with known optical counterparts, the visual extinction correlates well with the X-ray derived dust scattering optical depth tau{\_}sca{\_}: tau{\_}sca{\_}=0.087xA{\_}v{\_}(mag)xE(keV){\^{}}-2{\^{}} and$\backslash$nN{\_}H{\_}[cm{\^{}}-2{\^{}}/A{\_}v{\_}]=1.79x10{\^{}}21{\^{}}. The strong correlation between both quantities indicates that, with only few exceptions, intrinsic$\backslash$nabsorption by the X-ray source itself does not affect the derived absorption column densities. This method offers also the interesting possibility of verifying the optical identification of an X-ray source by using an X-ray property itself. In particular we find that for Cas A the optical extinction and the derived X-ray scattering are on the regression line but are too low for the observed absorption. Since Cas A's supernova was not observed optically, this supernova event must have been obscured by a local dust cloud. Finally, we have found a high degree of azimuthal symmetry in all the dust scattering halos of our sample, indicating, that the majority of dust grains responsible for the halo formation cannot be highly clumped in clouds.},

However, there is a strong correlation between LX;iso and the beaming fractions, fb ½1 cosðjÞ. As a result, the true X-ray luminosity of GRB afterglows, LX ¼ fbLX;iso, is approximately constant, with a dispersion of only a factor of 2. Since eEb / LX, the strong clustering of LX directly implies that the adiabatic blast wave kinetic energy in the afterglow phase, Eb, is tightly clustered. The narrow distribution of LX also suggests that p 2, that inverse Compton emission does not in general dominate the observed X-ray luminosity, and that radiative losses at t {\textless} 10 hr are relatively small. Thus, despite the large diversity in the observed properties of GRBs and their afterglows, the energy imparted by the GRB central engine to the relativistic ejecta is approximately constant.},

abstract = {We report the results of a spectroscopic search for Ly$\alpha$ emission from gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies. Based on a well-defined parent sample (the TOUGH sample) of 69 x-ray-selected Swift GRBs, we have targeted the hosts of a subsample of 20 GRBs known from afterglow spectroscopy to be in the redshift range z = 1.8-4.5. We have obtained spectroscopy using the FORS1 instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope to search for the presence of Ly$\alpha$ emission from the host galaxies. We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission from 7 out of the 20 hosts, with the typical limiting 3$\sigma$ line flux being 8 × 10-18 erg cm-2 s-1, corresponding to an Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of 6 × 1041 erg s-1 at z = 3. The Ly$\alpha$ luminosities for the seven hosts in which we detect Ly$\alpha$ emission are in the range (0.6-2.3) × 1042 erg s-1, corresponding to star formation rates of 0.6-2.1 M ⊙ yr-1 (not corrected for extinction). The rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EWs) for the seven hosts are in the range 9-40 {\AA}. For 6 of the 13 hosts for which Ly$\alpha$ is not detected, we place fairly strong 3$\sigma$ upper limits on the EW ({\textless}20 {\AA}), while for others the EW is either unconstrained or has a less constraining upper limit. We find that the distribution of Ly$\alpha$ EWs is inconsistent with being drawn from the Ly$\alpha$ EW distribution of bright Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at the 98.3{\%} level, in the sense that the TOUGH hosts on average have larger EWs than bright LBGs. We can exclude an early indication, based on a smaller, heterogeneous sample of pre-Swift GRB hosts, that all GRB hosts are Ly$\alpha$ emitters. We find that the TOUGH hosts on average have lower EWs than the pre-Swift GRB hosts, but the two samples are only inconsistent at the 92{\%} level. The velocity centroid of the Ly$\alpha$ line (where detected) is redshifted by 200-700 km s-1 with respect to the systemic velocity (taken to be the afterglow redshift), similar to what is seen for LBGs, possibly indicating star-formation-driven outflows from the host galaxies. There seems to be a trend between the Ly$\alpha$ EW and the optical to x-ray spectral index of the afterglow ($\beta$OX), hinting that dust plays a role in the observed strength and even presence of Ly$\alpha$ emission.

We present multiwavelength observations of GRB 060121, the first short burst observed to clearly outshine its host galaxy (by a factor {\textgreater}102). A photometric redshift for this event places the progenitor at a most probable redshift of z = 4.6, with a less probable scenario of z = 1.7. In either case, GRB 060121 could be the farthermost short-population GRB detected to date and implies an isotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma rays comparable to that seen in long-population bursts. We discuss the implications of the released energy on the nature of the progenitor. These results suggest that GRB 060121 may belong to a family of energetic short-population events, lying at z {\textgreater} 1 and whose optical afterglows would outshine their host galaxies, unlike the first short GRBs observed in 2005.

abstract = {The intrinsic X-ray emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is often found to be absorbed over and above the column density through our own Galaxy. The extra component is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the host galaxy of the GRB itself. There is an apparent correlation between the equivalent column density of hydrogen, N H,intrinsic (assuming it to be at the GRB redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z {\textgreater} 6 GRBs showing the greatest intrinsic column densities. We investigate the N H,intrinsic −z relation using a large sample of Swift GRBs, as well as active galactic nuclei and quasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energy distributions of the two highest redshift GRBs. Various possible sample biases and systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and we conclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. This may indicate either an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contribution from gas along the line of sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) or intervening absorbing clouds. Employing a more realistic model for IGM absorption than in previous works, we find that this may explain much of the observed opacity at z 3 providing it is not too hot, likely between 10 5 and 10 6.5 K, and moderately metal enriched, Z ∼ 0.2 Z . This material could therefore constitute the warm– hot intergalactic medium. However, a comparable level of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of intervening cold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to say which, if either, dominates. At lower redshifts, we conclude that gas in the host galaxies must be the dominant contributor to the observed X-ray absorption.},

abstract = {X-shooter is the first 2nd generation instrument of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). It is a very efficient, single-target, intermediate-resolution spectrograph that was installed at the Cassegrain focus of UT2 in 2009. The instrument covers, in a single exposure, the spectral range from 300 to 2500 nm. It is designed to maximize the sensitivity in this spectral range through dichroic splitting in three arms with optimized optics, coatings, dispersive elements and detectors. It operates at intermediate spectral resolution (R {\~{}} 4000-17 000, depending on wavelength and slit width) with fixed {\'{e}}chelle spectral format (prism cross-dispersers) in the three arms. It includes a 1.8″ × 4″ integral field unit as an alternative to the 11'' long slits. A dedicated data reduction package delivers fully calibrated two-dimensional and extracted spectra over the full wavelength range. We describe the main characteristics of the instrument and present its performance as measured during commissioning, science verification and the first months of science operations.},

abstract = {In recent years, the number of pulsars with secure mass measurements has increased to a level that allows us to probe the underlying neutron star (NS) mass distribution in detail. We critically review the radio pulsar mass measurements. For the first time, we are able to analyze a sizable population of NSs with a flexible modeling approach that can effectively accommodate a skewed underlying distribution and asymmetric measurement errors. We find that NSs that have evolved through different evolutionary paths reflect distinctive signatures through dissimilar distribution peak and mass cutoff values. NSs in double NS and NS-white dwarf (WD) systems show consistent respective peaks at 1.33 M ⊙ and 1.55 M ⊙, suggesting significant mass accretion ($\Delta$m ≈ 0.22 M ⊙) has occurred during the spin-up phase. The width of the mass distribution implied by double NS systems is indicative of a tight initial mass function while the inferred mass range is significantly wider for NSs that have gone through recycling. We find a mass cutoff at {\~{}}2.1 M ⊙ for NSs with WD companions, which establishes a firm lower bound for the maximum NS mass. This rules out the majority of strange quark and soft equation of state models as viable configurations for NS matter. The lack of truncation close to the maximum mass cutoff along with the skewed nature of the inferred mass distribution both enforce the suggestion that the 2.1 M ⊙ limit is set by evolutionary constraints rather than nuclear physics or general relativity, and the existence of rare supermassive NSs is possible.},

abstract = {We present early optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and host galaxy of the bright short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 130603B discovered by the Swift satellite. Using our Target of Opportunity program on the Gemini South telescope, our prompt optical spectra reveal a strong trace from the afterglow superimposed on continuum and emission lines from the z = 0.3568 ± 0.0005 host galaxy. The combination of a relatively bright optical afterglow (r' = 21.52 at $\Delta$t = 8.4 hr), together with an observed offset of 0.''9 from the host nucleus (4.8 kpc projected distance at z = 0.3568), allow us to extract a relatively clean spectrum dominated by afterglow light. Furthermore, the spatially resolved spectrum allows us to constrain the properties of the explosion site directly, and compare these with the host galaxy nucleus, as well as other short-duration GRB host galaxies. We find that while the host is a relatively luminous (L $\backslash$approx 0.8 $\backslash$,L{\^{}}{\{}*{\}}{\_}{\{}B{\}}), star-forming (SFR = 1.84 M ☉ yr–1) galaxy with almost solar metallicity, the spectrum of the afterglow exhibits weak Ca II absorption features but negligible emission features. The explosion site therefore lacks evidence of recent star formation, consistent with the relatively long delay time distribution expected in a compact binary merger scenario. The star formation rate (SFR; both in an absolute sense and normalized to the luminosity) and metallicity of the host are both consistent with the known sample of short-duration GRB hosts and with recent results which suggest GRB 130603B emission to be the product of the decay of radioactive species produced during the merging process of a neutron-star-neutron-star binary ("kilonova"). Ultimately, the discovery of more events similar to GRB 130603B and their rapid follow-up from 8 m class telescopes will open new opportunities for our understanding of the final stages of compact-objects binary systems and provide crucial information (redshift, metallicity, and chemical content of their explosion site) to characterize the environment of one of the most promising gravitational wave sources.},

abstract = {The final chapter in the long-standing mystery of the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) centres on the origin of the short-hard class of bursts, which are suspected on theoretical grounds to result from the coalescence of neutron-star or black-hole binary systems. Numerous searches for the afterglows of short-hard bursts have been made, galvanized by the revolution in our understanding of long-duration GRBs that followed the discovery in 1997 of their broadband (X-ray, optical and radio) afterglow emission. Here we present the discovery of the X-ray afterglow of a short-hard burst, GRB 050709, whose accurate position allows us to associate it unambiguously with a star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 0.160, and whose optical lightcurve definitively excludes a supernova association. Together with results from three other recent short-hard bursts, this suggests that short-hard bursts release much less energy than the long-duration GRBs. Models requiring young stellar populations, such as magnetars and collapsars, are ruled out, while coalescing degenerate binaries remain the most promising progenitor candidates.},

abstract = {The Lyman-alpha (Lya) recombination line is a fundamental tool for galaxy evolution studies and modern observational cosmology. However, subsequent interpretations are still prone to a number of uncertainties. Besides numerical efforts, empirical data are urgently needed for a better understanding of Lya escape process. We empirically estimate the Lyman-alpha escape fraction fesc(Lya) in a statistically significant sample of z {\~{}} 0 - 0.3 galaxies in order to calibrate high-redshift Lyman-alpha observations. An optical spectroscopic follow-up of a sub-sample of 24 Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) detected by GALEX at z {\~{}} 0.2-0.3, combined with a UV-optical sample of local starbursts, both with matched apertures, allow us to quantify the dust extinction through Balmer lines, and to estimate the Lyman-alpha escape fraction from the Halpha flux corrected for extinction in the framework of the recombination theory. The global escape fraction of Lyman-alpha radiation spans nearly the entire range of values, from 0.5 to 100 {\%}, and fesc(Lya) clearly decreases with increasing nebular dust extinction E(B-V). Several objects show fesc(Lya) greater than fesc(continuum) which may be an observational evidence for clumpy ISM geometry or for an aspherical ISM. Selection biases and aperture size effects may still prevail between z {\~{}} 0.2-0.3 LAEs and local starbursts, which may explain the difference observed for fesc(Lya).},

abstract = {We present a detailed assessment of the various dynamical pathways leading to the coalescence of compact objects in globular clusters (GCs) and Short Gamma-ray Burst (SGRB) production. We consider primordial binaries, dynamically formed binaries (through tidal two-body and three-body exchange interactions), and direct impacts of compact objects (WD/NS/BH). Here, we show that if the primordial binary fraction is small, close encounters dominate the production rate of coalescing compact systems. We find that the two dominant channels are the interaction of field neutron stars (NSs) with dynamically formed binaries and two-body encounters. Under such conditions, we estimate the redshift distribution and host galaxy demographics of SGRB progenitors, and find that GCs can provide a significant contribution to the overall observed rate. Regarding the newly identified channel of close stellar encounters involving WD/NS/BH, we have carried out precise modeling of the hydrodynamical evolution, giving us a detailed description of the resulting merged system. Our calculations show that there is in principle no problem in accounting for the global energy budget of a typical SGRB. The particulars of each encounter, however, are variable in several aspects and can lead to interesting diversity. First and most importantly, the characteristics of the encounter are highly dependent on the impact parameter. This is in contrast to the merger scenario, where the masses of the compact objects dictate a typical length and luminosity scale for SGRB activity. Second, the nature of the compact star itself can produce very different outcomes. Finally, the presence of tidal tails in which material will fall back onto the central object at a later time is a robust feature of the present set of calculations. The mass involved in these structures is considerably larger than for binary mergers. It is thus possible to account generically in this scenario for a prompt episode of energy release, as well as for activity many dynamical time scales later.},

The ultraviolet{\`{E}}optical rest-frame SEDs of the galaxies are much bluer than those of present-day spiral and elliptical galaxies and are generally similar to those of local star-burst galaxies with modest amounts of reddening. We use stellar population synthesis models to study the properties of the stars that dominate the light from LBGs. Under the assumption that the star for-mation rate is continuous or decreasing with time, the best-Ðtting models provide a lower bound on the LBG mass estimates. LBGs with " " L * {\"{I}}{\"{I}} UV luminosities are estimated to have minimum stellar masses D1010 or roughly 1/10 that of a present-day L * galaxy, similar to the mass of the Milky Way M {\_} , bulge. By considering the photometric e ects of a second stellar population component of maximally old stars, we set an upper bound on the stellar masses that is D3{\`{E}}8 times the minimum mass estimate. The stellar masses derived for bright LBGs are similar to published estimates of their dynamical masses based on nebular emission line widths, suggesting that such kinematic measurements may substantially underestimate the total masses of the dark matter halos. We Ðnd only loose constraints on the individual galaxy ages, extinction, metallicities, initial mass functions, and prior star formation histories. Most LBGs are well Ðtted by models with population ages that range from 30 Myr to D1 Gyr, although for models with subsolar metallicities a signiÐcant minority of galaxies are well Ðtted by very young ([10 Myr), very dusty stellar populations, A(1700 mag.

We also Ðnd that the typical ages for the observed star formation events are signiÐcantly younger than the time interval covered by this red-shift range (D1.5 Gyr). From this, and from the relative absence of candidates for quiescent, non{\`{E}}star-forming galaxies at these redshifts in the NICMOS data that might correspond to the fading remnants of galaxies formed at higher redshift, we suggest that star formation in LBGs may be recurrent, with short duty cycles and a timescale between star formation events of Gyr.},

Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr.

abstract = {(Abridged) The two high-redshift gamma-ray bursts, GRB 080913 at z=6.7 and GRB 090423 at z=8.3, recently detected by Swift appear as intrinsically short, hard GRBs. They could have been recognized by BATSE as short/hard GRBs should they have occurred at z {\textless}= 1. We perform a more thorough investigation on two physically distinct types (Type I/II) of cosmological GRBs and their observational characteristics. We reiterate the definitions of Type I/II GRBs and review the observational criteria and their physical motivations. Contrary to the traditional approach of assigning the physical category based on the gamma-ray properties (duration, hardness, and spectral lag), we take an alternative approach to define the Type I and Type II Gold Samples using several criteria that are more directly related to the GRB progenitors, and study the properties of the two Gold Samples and compare them with the traditional long/soft and short/hard samples. We find that the Type II Gold Sample reasonably tracks the long/soft population, although it includes several intrinsically short (shorter than 1s in the rest frame) GRBs. The Type I Gold Sample only has 5 GRBs, 4 of which are not strictly short but have extended emission. Other short/hard GRBs detected in the Swift era represent the BATSE short/hard sample well, but it is unclear whether all of them belong to Type I. We suggest that some (probably even most) high-luminosity short/hard GRBs instead belong to Type II. We suggest that GRB 080913 and GRB 090423 are more likely Type II events. We re-emphasize the importance of invoking multiple observational criteria, and cautiously propose an operational procedure to infer the physical origin of a given GRB with available multiple observational criteria, with various caveats laid out.},

abstract = {Context. Among the different observational techniques used to select high-redshift galaxies, the hydrogen recombination line Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) is of particular interest because it gives access to the measurement of cosmological quantities such as the star formation rate (SFR) of distant galaxy populations. However, interpreting this line and calibrating such observables are still subject to serious uncertainties. Aims: In this context, it important to understand the mechanisms responsible for the attenuation of Ly$\alpha$ emission, and under what conditions the Ly$\alpha$ emission line can be used as a reliable star formation diagnostic tool. Methods: We used a sample of 24 Ly$\alpha$ emitters at z {\~{}} 0.3 with an optical spectroscopic follow-up to calculate the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and its dependence upon different physical properties. We also examined the reliability of Ly$\alpha$ as a SFR indicator. We combined these observations with a compilation of Ly$\alpha$ emitters selected at z = 0-0.3 from the literature to assemble a larger sample. Results: We confirm that the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction clearly depends on the dust extinction following the relation fesc(Ly$\alpha$) = CLy$\alpha$ × 10-0.4 E(B-V) kLy$\alpha$ where kLy$\alpha$ {\~{}} 6.67 and CLy$\alpha$ = 0.22. However, the correlation does not follow the expected curve for a simple dust attenuation. A higher attenuation can be attributed to a scattering process, while fesc(Ly$\alpha$) values that are clearly above the continuum extinction curve can be the result of various mechanisms that can lead to an enhancement of the Ly$\alpha$ output. We also observe that the strength of Ly$\alpha$ and the escape fraction appear unrelated to the galaxy metallicity. Regarding the reliability of Ly$\alpha$ as a SFR indicator, we show that the deviation of SFR(Ly$\alpha$) from the true SFR (as traced by the UV continuum) is a function of the observed SFR(UV), which can be seen as the decrease in fesc(Ly$\alpha$) with increasing UV luminosity. Moreover, we observe redshift dependence of this relationship, revealing the underlying evolution of fesc(Ly$\alpha$) with redshift.

abstract = {We present optical spectra of the host galaxies of the short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 070429B and the likely short-duration with extended emission GRB 070714B. In both cases, we find a single emission line that we identify as [O II] $\lambda$ 3727 at z ∼ 0.9. Both events are more distant than any previous short-duration GRB with a secure host association from the sub-arcsecond position of an optical afterglow. GRBs 070429B and 070714B provide strong evidence in support of our previous claims in Berger et al. that a significant fraction of short-duration hosts (33{\%}) reside at z {\textgreater} 0.7. We discuss the implications of the existence this population on the energetics of short-duration GRBs, as well as on progenitor models. In the context of the degenerate binary merger scenario, such events require progenitor systems with a range of lifetimes and disfavor progenitor models with a long, narrow lifetime distribution. Subject headings: gamma-rays: bursts 1. INTRODUCTION Much like their long-duration cousins, the discovery of the first X-ray (Gehrels et al. 2005; Bloom et al. 2006), op-tical (Hjorth et al. 2005), and radio (Berger et al. 2005b) afterglows of short-duration (∆t 2 s) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has driven great progress in recent years. Based primarily on the discovery of the first four afterglows, GRB 050509B (z = 0.225; Gehrels et al. 2005; Bloom et al. 2006), GRB 050709 (z = 0.1606; Villasenor et al. 2005; Hjorth et al. 2005; Fox et al. 2005), GRB 050724 (z = 0.257; Barthelmy et al. 2005b; Berger et al. 2005b; Grupe et al. 2006), and GRB 051221 (z = 0.5465; Soderberg et al. 2006; Burrows et al. 2006), a general picture of short-duration GRB hosts quickly emerged. Unlike long-duration events, short-duration GRBs occur in both early-and late-type galaxies, all at relatively low redshift (compared to ¯ z ≈ 3 for long-duration Swift GRBs; Berger et al. 2005a; Jakobsson et al. 2006).

abstract = {Context. Gamma-ray bursts are usually classified in terms their high-energy emission into either short-duration or long-duration bursts, which presumably reflect two different types of progenitors. However, it has been shown on statistical grounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classification scheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so far not been performed. The large amount of follow-up studies generated during the Swift era allows us to have a sufficient sample to attempt a study of this third population through the properties of their prompt emission and their afterglows. Aims: To understand the differences of the intermediate population, we study a sample of GRBs observed by Swift during its first four years of operation. The sample contains only bursts with measured redshifts since these data help us to derive intrinsic properties. Methods: We search for differences in the properties of the three groups of bursts, which we quantify using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test whenever possible. Results: Intermediate bursts are found to be less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than long GRBs, especially when considering the X-ray light curves, which are on average one order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. There is a less significant trend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer than long bursts. Except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties to long bursts. In particular, they follow the Epeak versus Eiso correlation and have, on average, positive spectral lags with a distribution similar to that of long bursts. As for long GRBs, they normally have an associated supernova, although some intermediate bursts have been found to contain no supernova component. Conclusions: This study shows that intermediate bursts differ from short bursts, but exhibit no significant differences from long bursts apart from their lower brightness. We suggest that the physical difference between intermediate and long bursts could be explained by being produced by similar progenitors, of the former being the ejecta thin shells and the latter thick shells.},

abstract = {The SUperluminous Supernova Host galaxIES (SUSHIES) survey aims to provide strong new constraints on the progenitors of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) by understanding the relationship to their host galaxies. Here, we present the photometric properties of 53 H-poor and 16 H-rich SLSN host galaxies out to {\$}z\backslashsim4{\$}. We model the spectral energy distributions of the hosts to derive physical properties (e.g., stellar mass and star-formation-rate distribution functions), which we compare with other established galaxy populations. At low redshift, H-poor SLSNe are preferentially found in very blue, low-mass galaxies with high average specific star-formation rates. As the redshift increases, the host population follows the general evolution of star-forming galaxies towards more luminous galaxies with higher absolute star-formation rates. After accounting for secular evolution, we find evidence for differential evolution in galaxy mass, but not in the {\$}B{\$}-band and the far UV luminosity ({\$}3\backslashsigma{\$} confidence). Most remarkable is the scarcity of hosts with stellar masses above {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$} {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} for both classes of SLSNe at all redshifts. In the case of H-poor SLSNe, we attribute this to a metallicity cut-off at {\$}\backslashsim0.4{\$} solar metallicity, above which the production efficiency is stifled. However, we argue that, in addition to a low metallicity, a short-lived stellar population is also required as a regulating factor for the SLSN production. Although the host population of H-rich SLSNe is very diverse, and therefore they show a weaker dependence on environmental properties, the lack of massive hosts suggests a stifled production efficiency above {\$}\backslashsim0.8{\$} solar metallicity. The large dispersion of the SLSN-IIn host properties is in stark contrast to those of GRB, ordinary core-collapse SN, and SLSN-I host galaxies. We propose that multiple progenitor channels give rise to SLSNe-IIn.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are traditionally divided into long and short according to their durations (2 s). It was generally believed that this reflects a different physical origin: collapsars (long) and non-collapsars (short). We have recently shown that the duration distribution of collapsars is flat, namely, independent of the duration, at short durations. Using this model for the distribution of Collapsars we determine the duration distribution of non-Collapsars and estimate the probability that a burst with a given duration (and hardness) is a Collapsar or not. We find that this probability depends strongly on the spectral window of the observing detector. While the commonly used limit of 2 s is conservative and suitable for BATSE bursts, 40{\%} of Swift's bursts shorter than 2 s are Collapsars and the division 0.8 s is more suitable for Swift. We find that the duration overlap of the two populations is very large. On the one hand there is a non-negligible fraction of non-Collapsars longer than 10 s, while on the other hand even bursts shorter than 0.5 s in the Swift sample have a non-negligible probability to be Collapsars. Our results enable the construction of non-Collapsar samples while controlling the Collapsar contamination. They also highlight that no firm conclusions can be drawn based on a single burst and they have numerous implications concerning previous studies of non-Collapsar properties that were based on the current significantly contaminated Swift samples of localized short GRBs. Specifically (1) all known short bursts with z {\textgreater} 1 are most likely Collapsars; (2) the only short burst with a clear jet break is most likely a Collapsar, indicating our lack of knowledge concerning non-Collapsar beaming; and (3) the existence of non-Collapsars with durations up to 10 s imposes new challenges to non-Collapsar models.},

abstract = {We present the results of a systematic study of the rest-frame UV spectroscopic properties of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). The database of almost 1000 LBG spectra proves useful for constructing high S/N composite spectra. The composite spectrum of the entire sample reveals a wealth of features attributable to hot stars, HII regions, dust, and outflowing neutral and ionized gas. By grouping the database according to galaxy parameters such as Lyman-alpha equivalent width, UV spectral slope, and interstellar kinematics, we isolate some of the major trends in LBG spectra which are least compromised by selection effects. We find that LBGs with stronger Lyman-alpha emission have bluer UV continua, weaker low-ionization interstellar absorption lines, smaller kinematic offsets between Lyman-alpha and the interstellar absorption lines, and lower star-formation rates. There is a decoupling between the dependence of low- and high-ionization outflow features on other spectral properties. Most of the above trends can be explained in terms of the properties of the large-scale outflows seen in LBGs. According to this scenario, the appearance of LBG spectra is determined by a combination of the covering fraction of outflowing neutral gas which contains dust, and the range of velocities over which this gas is absorbing. Higher sensitivity and spectral resolution observations are still required for a full understanding of the covering fraction and velocity dispersion of the outflowing neutral gas in LBGs, and its relationship to the escape fraction of Lyman continuum radiation in galaxies at z{\~{}}3.},

abstract = {We present the observed offsets of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) from their putative host galaxies and compare them to the expected distributions of merging compact object binaries, given the observed properties of the hosts. We find that for all but one burst in our sample the offsets are consistent with this model. For the case of bursts with massive elliptical host galaxies, the circular velocities of the hosts' haloes exceed the natal velocities of almost all our compact object binaries. Hence the extents of the predicted offset distributions for elliptical galaxies are determined largely by their spatial extents. In contrast, for spiral hosts the galactic rotation velocities are smaller than typical binary natal velocities and the predicted burst offset distributions are more extended than the galaxies. One SGRB, 060502B, apparently has a large radial offset that is inconsistent with an origin in a merging galactic compact binary. Although it is plausible that the host of GRB 060502B is mis-identified, our results show that the large offset is compatible with a scenario where at least a few per cent of SGRBs are created by the merger of compact binaries that form dynamically in globular clusters.},

abstract = {Data from complex modern astronomical instruments often consist of a large number of different science and calibration files, and their reduction requires a variety of software tools. The execution chain of the tools represents a complex workflow that needs to be tuned and supervised, often by individual researchers that are not necessarily experts for any specific instrument. The efficiency of data reduction can be improved by using automatic workflows to organise data and execute the sequence of data reduction steps. To realize such efficiency gains, we designed a system that allows intuitive representation, execution and modification of the data reduction workflow, and has facilities for inspection and interaction with the data. The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has developed Reflex, an environment to automate data reduction workflows. Reflex is implemented as a package of customized components for the Kepler workflow engine. Kepler provides the graphical user interface to create an executable flowchart-like representation of the data reduction process. Key features of Reflex are a rule-based data organiser, infrastructure to re-use results, thorough book-keeping, data progeny tracking, interactive user interfaces, and a novel concept to exploit information created during data organisation for the workflow execution. Reflex includes novel concepts to increase the efficiency of astronomical data processing. While Reflex is a specific implementation of astronomical scientific workflows within the Kepler workflow engine, the overall design choices and methods can also be applied to other environments for running automated science workflows.},

The early afterglow fades rapidly with alpha{\{}{\textless}{\}}-2.6 at t{\{}{\~{}}{\}}8-32 hr post-burst and has a spectral index of beta=-1.5 (F{\{}{\_}{\}}nu t{\{}{\^{}}{\}}alpha*nu{\{}{\^{}}{\}}beta), leading to an expected near-IR brightness at the time of the first HST observation of m(F160W){\{}{\textgreater}{\}}29.3 AB mag. Instead, the detected source has m(F160W)=25.8+/-0.2 AB mag, corresponding to a rest-frame absolute magnitude of M(J)=-15.2 mag. The upper limit in the HST optical observations is m(F606W){\{}{\textgreater}{\}}27.7 AB mag (3-sigma), indicating an unusually red color of V-H{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}1.9 mag. Comparing the observed near-IR luminosity to theoretical models of kilonovae produced by ejecta from the merger of an NS-NS or NS-BH binary, we infer an ejecta mass of M{\{}{\_}{\}}ej{\{}{\~{}}{\}}0.03-0.08 Msun for v{\{}{\_}{\}}ej=0.1-0.3c. The inferred mass matches the expectations from numerical merger simulations. The presence of a kilonova provides the strongest evidence to date that short GRBs are produced by compact object mergers, and provides initial insight on the ejected mass and the primary role that compact object merger may play in the r-process. Equally important, it demonstrates that gravitational wave sources detected by Advanced LIGO/Virgo will be accompanied by optical/near-IR counterparts with unusually red colors, detectable by existing and upcoming large wide-field facilities (e.g., Pan-STARRS, DECam, Subaru, LSST).},

abstract = {Long duration gamma-ray bursts are commonly associated with the deaths of massive stars. Spectroscopic studies using the afterglow as a light source provide a unique opportunity to unveil the medium surrounding it, probing the densest region of their galaxies. This material is usually in a low ionization state and at large distances from the burst site, hence representing the normal interstellar medium in the galaxy. Here we present the case of GRB 090426 at z= 2.609, whose optical spectrum indicates an almost fully ionized medium together with a low column density of neutral hydrogen. For the first time, we also observe variations in the Ly$\alpha$ absorption line. Photoionization modelling shows that we are probing material from the vicinity of the burst (˜80 pc). The host galaxy is a complex of two luminous interacting galaxies, which might suggest that this burst could have occurred in an isolated star-forming region outside its host galaxy created in the interaction of the two galaxies.},

If continuously produced, the Interstellar Medium is expected to build-up a quasi-steady state of abundances of short-lived nuclides (with half-lives ≤100 My), including actinides produced in r-process nucleosynthesis. Their existence in today's interstellar medium would serve as a radioactive clock and would establish that their production was recent. In particular (244)Pu, a radioactive actinide nuclide (half-life=81 My), can place strong constraints on recent r-process frequency and production yield. Here we report the detection of live interstellar (244)Pu, archived in Earth's deep-sea floor during the last 25 My, at abundances lower than expected from continuous production in the Galaxy by about 2 orders of magnitude. This large discrepancy may signal a rarity of actinide r-process nucleosynthesis sites, compatible with neutron-star mergers or with a small subset of actinide-producing supernovae.},

abstract = {We study the X-ray absorption of a complete sample of 99 bright Swift gamma-ray bursts. Over the last few years, a strong correlation between the intrinsic X-ray absorbing column density (N{\_}H(z)) and the redshift was found. This absorption excess in high-z GRBs is now thought to be due to the overlooked contribution of the absorption along the intergalactic medium, by means of both intervening objects and the diffuse warm-hot intergalactic medium along the line of sight. In this work we neglect the absorption along the IGM, because our purpose is to study the eventual effect of a radical change in the Galactic absorption model on the N{\_}H(z) distribution. Therefore, we derive the intrinsic absorbing column densities using two different Galactic absorption models, the Leiden Argentine Bonn HI survey and the more recent model including molecular hydrogen. We find that, if on the one hand the new Galactic model considerably affects the single column density values, on the other hand there is no drastic change in the distribution as a whole. It becomes clear that the contribution of Galactic column densities alone, no matter how improved, is not sufficient to change the observed general trend and it has to be considered as a second-order correction. The cosmological increase of N{\_}H(z) as a function of redshift persists and, in order to explain the observed distribution, it is necessary to include the contribution of both the diffuse intergalactic medium and the intervening systems along the line of sight of the GRBs.},

We present and release photometric redshifts for a uniquely large and deep sample of 522286 objects with i'{\_}AB≤ 25 in the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) "Deep Survey" fields D1, D2, D3, and D4, which cover a total effective area of 3.2 °{\^{}}2. Methods: . We use 3241 spectroscopic redshifts with 0 ≤ z ≤ 5 from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) as a calibration and training set to derive these photometric redshifts. Using the "Le Phare" photometric redshift code, we developed a robust calibration method based on an iterative zero-point refinement combined with a template optimisation procedure and the application of a Bayesian approach. This method removes systematic trends in the photometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophic errors (by a factor of 2), a significant improvement over traditional methods. We use our unique spectroscopic sample to present a detailed assessment of the robustness of the photometric redshift sample. Results: . For a sample selected at i'{\_}AB≤ 24, we reach a redshift accuracy of $\sigma$$\Delta$ z/(1+z)=0.029 with $\eta$=3.8{\%} of catastrophic errors ($\eta$ is defined strictly as those objects with |$\Delta$ z|/(1+z) {\textgreater} 0.15). The reliability of our photometric redshifts decreases for faint objects: we find $\sigma$$\Delta$ z/(1+z)=0.025, 0.034 and $\eta$=1.9{\%}, 5.5{\%} for samples selected at i'{\_}AB=17.5-22.5 and 22.5-24 respectively. We find that the photometric redshifts of starburst galaxies are less reliable: although these galaxies represent only 22{\%} of the spectroscopic sample, they are responsible for 50{\%} of the catastrophic errors. An analysis as a function of redshift demonstrates that our photometric redshifts work best in the redshift range 0.2≤ z ≤ 1.5. We find an excellent agreement between the photometric and the VVDS spectroscopic redshift distributions at i'{\_}AB≤ 24. Finally, we compare the redshift distributions of i' selected galaxies on the four CFHTLS deep fields, showing that cosmic variance is still present on fields of 0.7-0.9 deg{\^{}}2.

abstract = {Aims. Fermi can measure the spectral properties of gamma-ray bursts over a very large energy range and is opening a new window on the prompt emission of these energetic events. Localizations by the instruments on Fermi in combination with follow-up by Swift provide accurate positions for observations at longer wavelengths leading to the determination of redshifts, the true energy budget, host galaxy properties and facilitate comparison with pre-Fermi bursts. Methods. Multi-wavelength follow-up observations were performed on the afterglows of four bursts with high energy emission de-tected by Fermi/LAT : GRB 090323, GRB 090328, GRB 090510 and GRB 090902B. They were obtained in the optical/near-infrared bands with GROND mounted at the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope and additionally of GRB 090323 in the optical with the 2 m telescope in Tautenburg, Germany. Three of the events are classified as long bursts while GRB 090510 is a well localized short GRB with GeV emission. In addition, host galaxies were detected for three of the four bursts. Spectroscopic follow-up was initiated with the VLT for GRB 090328 and GRB 090510. Results. The afterglow observations in 7 bands are presented for all bursts and their host galaxies are investigated. Knowledge of the distance and the local dust extinction enables comparison of the afterglows of LAT-detected GRBs with the general sample. The spectroscopic redshifts of GRB 090328 and GRB 090510 were determined to be z = 0.7354 ± 0.0003 and z = 0.903 ± 0.001 and dust corrected star-formation rates of 4.8 M ⊙ yr −1 and 0.60 M ⊙ yr −1 were derived for their host galaxies, respectively. Conclusions. The afterglows of long bursts exhibit power-law decay indices ($\alpha$) from less than 1 to ∼2.3 and spectral indices ($\beta$ opt) values from 0.65 to ∼1.2 which are fairly standard for GRB afterglows. Constraints are placed on the jet half opening angles of 2.1 • to 6.4 • , which allows limits to be placed on the beaming corrected energies. These range from 5×10 50 erg to the one of the highest values ever recorded, 2.2 × 10 52 erg for GRB 090902B, and are not consistent with a standard candle. The extremely energetic long Fermi bursts have optical afterglows which lie in the top half of the brightness distribution of all optical afterglows detected in the Swift era or even in the top 5 {\%} if incompleteness is considered. The properties of the host galaxies of these LAT detected bursts in terms of extinction, star formation rates and masses do not appear to differ from previous samples.},

abstract = {We estimate the rate and the luminosity function of short (hard) Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs) that are non-Collapsars, using the peak fluxes and redshifts of BATSE, Swift and Fermi GRBs. Following Bromberg2013 we select a sub-sample of Swift bursts which are most likely non-Collapsars. We find that these sGRBs are delayed relative to the global star formation rate (SFR) with a typical delay time of a 3-4 Gyr (depending on the SFR model). However, if two or three sGRB at high redshifts have been missed because of selection effects, a distribution of delay times of {\~{}}1/t would be also compatible. The current event rate of these non-Collapsar sGRBs with L{\_}iso {\textgreater} 5*10{\^{}}49 erg/s is 4.1(-1.9,+2.3)Gpc{\^{}}-3 yr{\^{}}-1. The rate was significantly larger around z {\~{}} 1 and it declines since that time.

When considering the whole Swift sGRB sample we find that it is composed of two populations: One group ({\~{}} 60{\%}-80{\%} of Swift sGRBs) with the above rate and time delay and a second group ({\~{}} 20{\%}-40{\%} of Swift sGRBs) of potential "impostors" that follow the SFR with no delay. These two populations are in very good agreement with the division of sGRBs to non-Collapsars and Collapsars suggested recently by Bromberg2013. If non-Collapsar sGRBs arise from neutron star merger this rate suggest a detection rate of 3-100 yr{\^{}}-1 by a future gravitational wave detectors (e.g. Advanced Ligo/Virgo with detection horizon on 300 Mpc), and a co-detection with Fermi (Swift) rate of 0.1-1 yr{\^{}}-1 (0.02-0.14 yr{\^{}}-1). We estimate that about 4 * 10{\^{}}5 (f{\_}b{\^{}}-1 / 30) mergers took place in the Milky Way. If {\$}0.025 m{\_}\backslashodot{\$} were ejected in each event this would have been sufficient to produce all the heavy r-process material in the Galaxy.},

abstract = {Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are rapid, bright flashes of radiation peaking in the gamma-ray band occurring at an average rate of one event per day at cosmological distances. They are characterized by a collimated relativistic outflow pushing through the interstellar medium shining in gamma-rays powered by a central engine. This prompt phase is followed by a fading afterglow emission at longer wavelength, powered in part by the expanding outflow, and in part by continuous energy injection by the central engine. The observed evidences of supernovae associated to long GRBs (those with a duration of the gamma-ray emission {\textgreater}2 s) brought to a general consensus on indicating the core collapse of massive stars as the progenitor of these events. Following the most accredited model, short GRBs (the events with a duration of the gamma-ray emission ???2 s) originate from the coalescence of compact binary systems (two neutron stars or neutron star-black hole systems). This paper presents a review of the observational properties of short GRBs and shows how the study of these properties can be used as a tool to unveil their elusive progenitors and provide information on the nature of the central engine powering the observed emission. The increasing evidence for compact object binary progenitors makes short GRBs one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves for the forthcoming Advanced LIGO/Virgo experiments.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short, intense flashes of soft gamma-rays coming from the distant Universe. Long-duration GRBs (those lasting more than approximately 2 s) are believed to originate from the deaths of massive stars, mainly on the basis of a handful of solid associations between GRBs and supernovae. GRB 060614, one of the closest GRBs discovered, consisted of a 5-s hard spike followed by softer, brighter emission that lasted for approximately 100 s (refs 8, 9). Here we report deep optical observations of GRB 060614 showing no emerging supernova with absolute visual magnitude brighter than M(V) = -13.7. Any supernova associated with GRB 060614 was therefore at least 100 times fainter, at optical wavelengths, than the other supernovae associated with GRBs. This demonstrates that some long-lasting GRBs can either be associated with a very faint supernova or produced by different phenomena.},

abstract = {We present simultaneous optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of 19 Swift GRB host galaxies with VLT/X-shooter with the aim of measuring their redshifts. Galaxies were selected from The Optically Unbiased GRB Host (TOUGH) survey (15 of the 19 galaxies) or because they hosted GRBs without a bright optical afterglow. Here, we provide emission-line redshifts for 13 of the observed galaxies with brightnesses between F606W {\textgreater} 27 mag and R=22.9 mag (median R=24.6 mag). The median redshift is z=2.1 for all, and z=2.3 for the TOUGH hosts. Our new data significantly improve the redshift completeness of the TOUGH survey, which now stands at 77{\%} (53 out of 69 GRBs). They furthermore provide accurate redshifts for nine prototype-dark GRBs (e.g., GRBs 071021 at z=2.452 and 080207 at z=2.086), which are exemplary of GRBs where redshifts are challenging to obtain via afterglow spectroscopy. This establishes X-shooter spectroscopy as an efficient tool for redshift determination of faint, star-forming, high-redshift galaxies such as GRB hosts. It is hence a further step towards removing the bias in GRB samples that is caused by optically-dark events, and provides the basis for a better understanding of the conditions in which GRBs form. The distribution of column densities as measured from X-ray data (N{\_}{\{}H,X{\}}), for example, is closely related to the darkness of the afterglow and skewed towards low N{\_}{\{}H, X{\}} values in samples that are dominated by bursts with bright optical afterglows.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPublished in: Astrophys.

abstract = {We report the discovery of a unique z= 6.027 galaxy, multiply imaged by the cluster Abell 383 and detected in new Hubble Space Telescope ACS and WFC3 imaging, as well as in Warm Spitzer observations. This galaxy was selected as a pair of i-dropouts; its suspected high redshift was confirmed by the measurement of a strong Lyman a line in both images using Keck/DEIMOS. Combining Hubble and Spitzer photometry after correcting for contamination by line emission (estimated to be a small effect), we identify a strong Balmer break of 1.5 mag. Taking into account the magnification factor of 11.4 {\{}+/-{\}} 1.9 (2.65 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.17 mag) for the brightest image, the unlensed AB magnitude for the source is 27.2 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.05 in the H band, corresponding to a 0.4 L* galaxy, and 25.7 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.08 at 3.6 {\{}micro{\}}m. The UV slope is consistent with {\{}beta{\}}[{\~{}}] 2.0, and from the rest-frame UV continuum we measure a current star formation rate of 2.4 {\{}+/-{\}} 1.1 M{\{}odot{\}} yr-1. The unlensed half-light radius is measured to be 300 pc, from which we deduce a star-forming surface density of [{\~{}}]10 M{\{}odot{\}} yr-1 kpc-2. The Lyman emission is found to be extended over [{\~{}}]3 arcsec along the slit, corresponding to [{\~{}}]5 kpc in the source plane. This can be explained by the presence of a much larger envelope of neutral hydrogen around the star-forming region. Finally, fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) using seven photometric data points with simple SED models, we derive the following properties: very little reddening, an inferred stellar mass of M*= 6 x 109 M{\{}odot{\}}, and an inferred age of [{\~{}}]800 Myr (corresponding to a redshift of formation of [{\~{}}]18). The star formation rate of this object was likely much stronger in the past than at the time of observation, suggesting that we may be missing a fraction of galaxies at z[{\~{}}] 6 which have already faded in rest-frame UV wavelengths.},

abstract = {We study the optical and near-infrared luminosities and detectability of radioactively powered electromagnetic transients ('macronovae') occuring in the aftermath of binary neutron star and neutron star black hole mergers. We explore the transients that result from the dynamic ejecta and those from different types of wind outflows. Based on full nuclear network simulations we calculate the resulting light curves in different wavelength bands. We scrutinize the robustness of the results by comparing a) two different nuclear reaction networks and b) two macronova models. We explore in particular how sensitive the results are to the production of alpha-decaying trans-lead nuclei. We compare two frequently used mass models: the Finite-Range Droplet Model (FRDM) and the nuclear mass model of Duflo and Zuker (DZ31). We find that the abundance of alpha-decaying trans-lead nuclei has a significant impact on the observability of the resulting macronovae. For example, the DZ31 model yields considerably larger abundances resulting in larger heating rates and thermalization efficiencies and therefore predicts substantially brighter macronova transients. We find that the dynamic ejecta from NSNS models can reach peak K-band magnitudes in excess of -15 while those from NSBH cases can reach beyond -16. Similar values can be reached by some of our wind models. Several of our models (both wind and dynamic ejecta) yield properties that are similar to the transient that was observed in the aftermath of the short GRB 130603B. We further explore the expected macronova detection frequencies for current and future instruments such as VISTA, ZTF and LSST.},

abstract = {Using a two-dimensional hydrodynamics code (PROMETHEUS), we explore the continued evolution of rotating helium stars, M$\alpha${\textgreater}{\~{}}10 Msolar, in which iron-core collapse does not produce a successful outgoing shock but instead forms a black hole of 2-3 Msolar. The model explored in greatest detail is the 14 Msolar helium core of a 35 Msolar main-sequence star. The outcome is sensitive to the angular momentum. For j16≡j/(1016 cm2 s-1){\textless}{\~{}}3, material falls into the black hole almost uninhibited. No outflows are expected. For j16{\textgreater}{\~{}}20, the infalling matter is halted by centrifugal force outside 1000 km where neutrino losses are negligible. The equatorial accretion rate is very low, and explosive oxygen burning may power a weak equatorial explosion. For 3{\textless}{\~{}}j16{\textless}{\~{}}20, however, a reasonable value for such stars, a compact disk forms at a radius at which the gravitational binding energy can be efficiently radiated as neutrinos or converted to beamed outflow by magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) processes. These are the best candidates for producing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Here we study the formation of such a disk, the associated flow patterns, and the accretion rate for disk viscosity parameter $\alpha${\~{}}0.001 and 0.1. Infall along the rotational axis is initially uninhibited, and an evacuated channel opens during the first few seconds. Meanwhile the black hole is spun up by the accretion (to a{\~{}}0.9), and energy is dissipated in the disk by MHD processes and radiated by neutrinos. For the $\alpha$=0.1 model, appreciable energetic outflows develop between polar angles of 30° and 45°. These outflows, powered by viscous dissipation in the disk, have an energy of up to a few times 1051 ergs and a mass {\~{}}1 Msolar and are rich in 56Ni. They constitute a supernova-like explosion by themselves. Meanwhile accretion through the disk is maintained for approximately 10-20 s but is time variable (+/-30{\%}) because of hydrodynamical instabilities at the outer edge in a region where nuclei are experiencing photodisintegration. Because the efficiency of neutrino energy deposition is sensitive to the accretion rate, this instability leads to highly variable energy deposition in the polar regions. Some of this variability, which has significant power at 50 ms and overtones, may persist in the time structure of the burst. During the time followed, the average accretion rate for the standard $\alpha$=0.1 and j16=10 model is 0.07 Msolar s-1. The total energy deposited along the rotational axes by neutrino annihilation is (1-14)×1051 ergs, depending upon the evolution of the Kerr parameter and uncertain neutrino efficiencies. Simulated deposition of energy in the polar regions, at a constant rate of 5×1050 ergs s-1 per pole, results in strong relativistic outflow jets beamed to about 1{\%} of the sky. These jets may be additionally modulated by instabilities in the sides of the ``nozzle'' through which they flow. The jets blow aside the accreting material, remain highly focused, and are capable of penetrating the star in {\~{}}10 s. After the jet breaks through the surface of the star, highly relativistic flow can emerge. Because of the sensitivity of the mass ejection and jets to accretion rate, angular momentum, and disk viscosity, and the variation of observational consequences with viewing angle, a large range of outcomes is possible, ranging from bright GRBs like GRB 971214 to faint GRB-supernovae like SN 1998bw. X-ray precursors are also possible as the jet first breaks out of the star. While only a small fraction of supernovae make GRBs, we predict that collapsars will always make supernovae similar to SN 1998bw. However, hard, energetic GRBs shorter than a few seconds will be difficult to produce in this model and may require merging neutron stars and black holes for their explanation.},

abstract = {We present a framework to obtain photometric redshifts (photo-zs) for gamma-ray burst afterglows. Using multi-band photometry from GROND and Swift/UVOT, photo-zs are derived for five GRBs for which spectroscopic redshifts are not available. We use UV/optical/NIR data and synthetic photometry based on afterglow observations and theory to derive the photometric redshifts of GRBs and their accuracy. Taking into account the afterglow synchrotron emission properties, we investigate the application of photometry to derive redshifts in a theoretical range between z{\~{}}1 and z{\~{}}12. The measurement of photo-zs for GRB afterglows provides a quick, robust and reliable determination of the distance scale to the burst, particularly in those cases where spectroscopic observations in the optical/NIR range cannot be obtained. Given a sufficiently bright and mildly reddened afterglow, the relative photo-z accuracy is better than 10{\%} between z=1.5 and z{\~{}}7 and better than 5{\%} between z=2 and z=6. We detail the approach on 5 sources without spectroscopic redshifts observed with UVOT on-board Swift and/or GROND. The distance scale to those same afterglows is measured to be {\$}z=4.31{\^{}}{\{}+0.14{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.15{\}}{\$} for GRB 080825B, {\$}z=2.13{\^{}}{\{}+0.14{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.20{\}}{\$} for GRB 080906, {\$}z=3.44{\^{}}{\{}+0.15{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.32{\}}{\$} for GRB 081228, {\$}z=2.03{\^{}}{\{}+0.16{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.14{\}}{\$} for GRB 081230 and {\$}z=1.28{\^{}}{\{}+0.16{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.15{\}}{\$} for GRB 090530. Combining the response from UVOT with ground-based observatories and in particular GROND operating in the optical/NIR wavelength regime, reliable photo-zs can be obtained from z {\~{}} 1.0 out to z {\~{}} 10, and possibly even at higher redshifts in some favorable cases, provided that these GRBs exist, are localized quickly, have sufficiently bright afterglows and are not heavily obscured.},

abstract = {The Ly$\alpha$ emission line has been proven to be a powerful tool for studying evolving galaxies at the highest redshift. However, in order to use Ly$\alpha$ as a physical probe of galaxies, it becomes vital to know the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction (f Ly$\alpha$ esc). Unfortunately, due to the resonant nature of Ly$\alpha$, f Ly$\alpha$ esc may vary unpredictably and requires empirical measurement. Here, we compile Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions (LFs) between redshifts z = 0 and 8 and, combined with H$\alpha$ and ultraviolet data, assess how f Ly$\alpha$ esc evolves with redshift. We find a strong upward evolution in f Ly$\alpha$ esc over the range z = 0.3-6, which is well fit by the power law f Ly$\alpha$ escvprop(1 + z)$\xi$with $\xi$ = (2.57+0.19 -0.12). This predicts that f Ly$\alpha$ esc should reach unity at z = 11.1. By comparing f Ly$\alpha$ esc and E B-V in individual galaxies we derive an empirical relationship between f Ly$\alpha$ esc and E B-V , which includes resonance scattering and can explain the redshift evolution of f Ly$\alpha$ esc between z = 0 and 6 purely as a function of the evolution in the dust content of galaxies. Beyond z ≈ 6.5, f Ly$\alpha$ esc drops more substantially, an effect attributed to either ionizing photon leakage, or an increase in the neutral gas fraction of the intergalactic medium. While distinguishing between these two scenarios may be extremely challenging, by framing the problem this way we remove the uncertainty of the halo mass from Ly$\alpha$-based tests of reionization. We finally derive a new method by which to estimate the dust content of galaxies, based purely upon the observed Ly$\alpha$ and UV LFs. These data are characterized by an exponential with an e-folding scale of z EBV ≈ 3.4.},

abstract = {We present the discovery of the optical afterglow and early-type host galaxy of the short-duration GRB 100117A. The faint afterglow is detected 8.3 hr after the burst with r{\_}AB = 25.46 +/- 0.20 mag. Follow-up optical and near-IR observations uncover a coincident compact red galaxy, identified as an early-type galaxy at a photometric redshift of z{\~{}}0.6-0.9 (2-sigma) with a mass of 3x10{\^{}}10 M{\_}Sun, an age of {\~{}}1 Gyr, and a luminosity of L{\_}B{\~{}}0.5L{\_}star. Spectroscopic observations of the host reveal a notable break corresponding to the Balmer 4000-Angstrom break at z{\~{}}0.9, and stellar population spectral evolution template fits indicate z{\~{}}0.915, which we adopt as the redshift of the host, with stellar population ages of {\~{}}1-3 Gyr. From a possible weak detection of [OII]-3727 emission at z=0.915 we infer an upper bound on the star formation rate of {\~{}}0.1 M{\_}Sun per yr, leading to a specific star formation rate of {\textless}0.004 per Gyr. Thus, GRB 100117A is only the second short burst to date with a secure early-type host (the other being GRB 050724 at z=0.257) and it has one of the highest short GRB redshifts. The offset between the host center and the burst position, 470 +/- 310 pc, is the smallest to date. Combined with the old stellar population age, this indicates that the burst likely originated from a progenitor with no significant kick velocity. However, from the brightness of the optical afterglow we infer a relatively low density of n{\~{}}3x10{\^{}}-4 cm{\^{}}-3 when epsilon{\_}e and epsilon{\_}B = 0.1. The combination of an optically faint afterglow and host suggest that previous such events may have been missed, thereby potentially biasing the known short GRB host population against z{\textgreater}1 early-type hosts.},

abstract = {Measuring GRB properties in their rest-frame is crucial to understand the physics at work in gamma-ray bursts. This can only be done for GRBs with known redshift. Since redshifts are usually measured from the optical spectrum of the afterglow, correlations between prompt and afterglow emissions may introduce biases in the distribution of rest-frame properties of the prompt emission, especially considering that we measure the redshift of only one third of Swift GRBs. In this paper we study the brightness of optical GRB afterglows and the role of optical selection effects in the distribution of various intrinsic properties of GRBs and on the Epi - Eiso relation discovered by Amati et al. (2002). Our analysis is based on a sample of 85 GRBs with good optical follow-up and well measured prompt emission. 71 of them have a measure of redshift and 14 have no redshift. We discuss the connection between the location of GRBs in the Epi-Eiso plane and their optical brightness measured two hours after the trigger in the GRB rest frame. We show that the brightness of GRBs in our sample is mainly driven by their intrinsic luminosity and depends only slightly on their redshift. We also show that GRBs with faint afterglows are preferentially located in the upper part of the Epi-Eiso plane. This optical selection effect favors the detection of GRBs with bright afterglows located below the best fit Epi - Eiso relation whose redshift is easily measurable. We conclude that the distributions of prompt GRB properties in the rest frame undergo selection effects due to the need to measure the redshift from the optical afterglow emission. These biases put significant uncertanties when interpreting the statistical studies of GRB properties in the rest frame. We show that the Epi - Eiso relation is not immune to these selection effects.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive comparison of the properties of the radio through X-ray counterpart of GW170817 and the properties of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For this effort, we utilize a sample of 36 short GRBs spanning a redshift range of {\$}z \backslashapprox 0.12-2.6{\$} discovered over 2004-2017. We find that the counterpart to GW170817 has an isotropic-equivalent luminosity that is {\$}\backslashapprox 3000{\$} times less than the median value of on-axis short GRB X-ray afterglows, and {\$}\backslashgtrsim10{\^{}}{\{}4{\}}{\$} times less than that for detected short GRB radio afterglows. Moreover, the allowed jet energies and particle densities inferred from the radio and X-ray counterparts to GW170817 and on-axis short GRB afterglows are remarkably similar, suggesting that viewing angle effects are the dominant, and perhaps only, difference in their observed radio and X-ray behavior. From comparison to previous claimed kilonovae following short GRBs, we find that the optical and near-IR counterpart to GW170817 is comparatively under-luminous by a factor of {\$}\backslashapprox 3-5{\$}, indicating a range of kilonova luminosities and timescales. A comparison of the optical limits following short GRBs on {\$}\backslashlesssim 1{\$} day timescales also rules out a "blue" kilonova of comparable optical isotropic-equivalent luminosity in one previous short GRB. Finally, we investigate the host galaxy of GW170817, NGC4993, in the context of short GRB host galaxy stellar population properties. We find that NGC4993 is superlative in terms of its large luminosity, old stellar population age, and low star formation rate compared to previous short GRB hosts. Additional events within the Advanced LIGO/VIRGO volume will be crucial in delineating the properties of the host galaxies of NS-NS mergers, and connecting them to their cosmological counterparts.},

@article{DeUgartePostigo2014c,
abstract = {Context. Short duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are thought to be related to the violent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, which makes them promising sources of gravitational waves. The detection of a "kilonova"-likesignature associated to the Swift-detected GRB 130603B has suggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. Aims: Our knowledge on SGRB has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernova signatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always be securely associated. Further progress has been significantly hampered by the faintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), which has so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. Afterglow spectroscopy is the key tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced, crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. Methods: Here we present the first spectra of a prototypical SGRB afterglow in which both absorption and emission features are clearly detected. Together with multi-wavelength photometry we study the host and environment of GRB 130603B. Results: From these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z = 0.3565 ± 0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and a substantial line of sight extinction of AV = 0.86 ± 0.15 mag. The GRB was located at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy with near-solar metallicity. Unlike for most long GRBs (LGRBs), NHX/AV is consistent with the Galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differs from those found in LGRBs. Conclusions: The merger is not associated with the most star-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region, implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact object binary.

abstract = {Prediction of the soft X-ray absorption along lines of sight through our Galaxy is crucial for understanding the spectra of extragalactic sources, but requires a good estimate of the foreground column density of photoelectric absorbing species. Assuming uniform elemental abundances this reduces to having a good estimate of the total hydrogen column density, N(Htot)=N(HI)+2N(H2). The atomic component, N(HI), is reliably provided using the mapped 21 cm radio emission but estimating the molecular hydrogen column density, N(H2), expected for any particular direction, is difficult. The X-ray afterglows of GRBs are ideal sources to probe X-ray absorption in our Galaxy because they are extragalactic, numerous, bright, have simple spectra and occur randomly across the entire sky. We describe an empirical method, utilizing 493 afterglows detected by the Swift XRT, to determine N(Htot) through the Milky Way which provides an improved estimate of the X-ray absorption in our Galaxy and thereby leads to more reliable measurements of the intrinsic X-ray absorption and, potentially, other spectral parameters, for extragalactic X-ray sources. We derive a simple function, dependent on the product of the atomic hydrogen column density, N(HI), and dust extinction, E(B-V), which describes the variation of the molecular hydrogen column density, N(H2), of our Galaxy, over the sky. Using the resulting N(Htot) we show that the dust-to-hydrogen ratio is correlated with the carbon monoxide emission and use this ratio to estimate the fraction of material which forms interstellar dust grains. Our resulting recipe represents a significant revision in Galactic absorption compared to previous standard methods, particularly at low Galactic latitudes.},

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 $\mu$m, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive statistical analysis of Swift X-ray light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) collecting data from more than 650 GRBs discovered by Swift and other facilities. The unprecedented sample size allows us to constrain the rest-frame X-ray properties of GRBs from a statistical perspective, with particular reference to intrinsic time-scales and the energetics of the different light-curve phases in a common rest-frame 0.3-30 keV energy band. Temporal variability episodes are also studied and their properties constrained. Two fundamental questions drive this effort: (i) Does the X-ray emission retain any kind of `memory' of the prompt $\gamma$-ray phase? (ii) Where is the dividing line between long and short GRB X-ray properties? We show that short GRBs decay faster, are less luminous and less energetic than long GRBs in the X-rays, but are interestingly characterized by similar intrinsic absorption. We furthermore reveal the existence of a number of statistically significant relations that link the X-ray to prompt $\gamma$-ray parameters in long GRBs; short GRBs are outliers of the majority of these two-parameter relations. However and more importantly, we report on the existence of a universal three-parameter scaling that links the X-ray and the $\gamma$-ray energy to the prompt spectral peak energy of both long and short GRBs: EX, iso∝E1.00 ± 0.06$\gamma$, iso/E0.60 ± 0.10pk.},

We analysed the Swift/BAT data through a discrete cross-correlation function (CCF) fitted with an asymmetric Gaussian function to estimate the lag and the associated uncertainty. We find that half of the long GRBs have a positive lag and half a lag consistent with zero. All short GRBs have lags consistent with zero. The distributions of the spectral lags for short and long GRBs have different average values. Limited by the small number of short GRBs, we cannot exclude at more than 2 sigma significance level that the two distributions of lags are drawn from the same parent population. If we consider the entire sample of long GRBs, we do not find evidence for a lag-luminosity correlation, rather the lag-luminosity plane appears filled on the left hand side, thus suggesting that the lag-luminosity correlation could be a boundary.

abstract = {To test whether the short GRB rates, redshift distribution and host galaxies are consistent with current theoretical predictions, we use avery large database of population synthesis calculations to examine BH-NS and NS-NS merger rates in the universe, factoring in (i) the star formation history of the universe, (ii) a heterogeneous population of star-forming galaxies, including spirals and ellipticals, and (iii) a simple flux-limited selection model for short GRB detection. When we require our models reproduce the known short GRB rates and redshift measurements (and, for NS-NS, the merger rates extrapolated from binary pulsars in the Galaxy), a small fraction of models reproduce all observations, both when we assume a NS-NS and a BH-NS origin for bursts. Most commonly models produce mergers preferentially in spiral galaxies if short GRBs arise from NS-NS mergers alone. Model universes where present-day binary mergers occur preferentially in elliptical galaxies necessarily include a significant fraction of binaries with long delay times between birth and merger (often {\$}O(10{\{}\backslashrm Gyr{\}}){\$}). Though long delays occur, almost all of our models predict that a higher proportion of short GRBs should occur at moderate to high redshift (e.g., {\$}z{\textgreater}1{\$}) than has presently been observed, in agreement with recent observations which suggest a selection bias towards successful follow-up of low-redshift short GRBs. Finally, if only a fraction of BH-NS mergers have the right combination of masses and spins to make GRBs, then at best only a small fraction of BH-NS models could be consistent with all {\{}$\backslash$em current{\}} available data.

We detect the afterglows and host galaxies of two short bursts, and host galaxies for two additional bursts with known optical afterglow positions, and five with X-ray positions ({\textless}6'' radius). In eight of the nine cases we find that the most probable host galaxies are faint, R{\~{}}23-26.5 mag, and are therefore starkly different from the first few short GRB hosts with R{\~{}}17-22 mag and z{\textless}0.5. Indeed, we measure spectroscopic redshifts of z{\~{}}0.4-1.1 for the four brightest hosts. A comparison to large field galaxy samples, as well as the hosts of long GRBs and previous short GRBs, indicates that the fainter hosts likely reside at z{\textgreater}1. Our most conservative limit is that at least half of the five hosts without a known redshift reside at z{\textgreater}0.7 (97{\%} confidence level), suggesting that about 1/3-2/3 of all short GRBs originate at higher redshifts than previously determined. This has two important implications: (i) We constrain the acceptable age distributions to a wide lognormal (sigma{\textgreater}1) with tau{\~{}}4-8 Gyr, or to a power law, P(tau){\~{}}tau{\^{}}n, with -1{\textless}n{\textless}0; and (ii) the inferred isotropic energies, E{\_}{\{}gamma,iso{\}}{\~{}}10{\^{}}50-10{\^{}}52 erg, are significantly larger than {\~{}}10{\^{}}48-10{\^{}}49 erg for the low redshift short GRBs, indicating a large spread in energy release or jet opening angles. Finally, we re-iterate the importance of short GRBs as potential gravitational wave sources and find a conservative Advanced LIGO detection rate of {\~{}}2-6 yr{\^{}}-1.},

abstract = {Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are associated with the explosion of massive stars in star-forming regions. A large fraction of GRBs show intrinsic absorption as detected in optical spectra but absorption signatures are also detectable in the afterglow X-ray spectra. We present here a comprehensive analysis of the full sample of 93 GRBs with known redshift promptly observed by the Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT) up to 2009 June. The distribution of X-ray column densities clearly shows that GRBs are heavily absorbed indicating that they indeed occur in dense environments. Furthermore, there is a lack of heavily absorbed GRBs at low redshift (z {\textless}{\~{}} 1-2) that might therefore be candidates for the missing `dark' GRB population. However, there is no statistically significant correlation between the amount of X-ray absorption and the `darkness' of a GRB. Finally, we compare the hydrogen column densities derived in the optical with those derived from X-ray absorption. The two distributions are different, with the optical column densities being lower than the X-ray ones, which is even more apparent when correcting for metallicity effects. The most likely explanation is photoionization of hydrogen in the circumburst material caused by the radiation field of the burst.},

abstract = {The Swift mission, scheduled for launch in 2004, is a multiwavelength observatory for gamma-ray burst (GRB) astronomy. It is a first-of-its-kind autonomous rapid-slewing satellite for transient astronomy and pioneers the way for future rapid-reaction and multiwavelength missions. It will be far more powerful than any previous GRB mission, observing more than 100 bursts yr-1 and performing detailed X-ray and UV/optical afterglow observations spanning timescales from 1 minute to several days after the burst. The objectives are to (1) determine the origin of GRBs, (2) classify GRBs and search for new types, (3) study the interaction of the ultrarelativistic outflows of GRBs with their surrounding medium, and (4) use GRBs to study the early universe out to z {\textgreater} 10. The mission is being developed by a NASA-led international collaboration. It will carry three instruments: a new-generation wide-field gamma-ray (15-150 keV) detector that will detect bursts, calculate 1'-4' positions, and trigger autonomous spacecraft slews; a narrow-field X-ray telescope that will give 5'' positions and perform spectroscopy in the 0.2-10 keV band; and a narrow-field UV/optical telescope that will operate in the 170-600 nm band and provide 03 positions and optical finding charts. Redshift determinations will be made for most bursts. In addition to the primary GRB science, the mission will perform a hard X-ray survey to a sensitivity of {\~{}}1 mcrab ({\~{}}2 × 10-11 ergs cm-2 s-1 in the 15-150 keV band), more than an order of magnitude better than HEAO 1 A-4. A flexible data and operations system will allow rapid follow-up observations of all types of high-energy transients, with rapid data downlink and uplink available through the NASA TDRSS system. Swift transient data will be rapidly distributed to the astronomical community, and all interested observers are encouraged to participate in follow-up measurements. A Guest Investigator program for the mission will provide funding for community involvement. Innovations from the Swift program applicable to the future include (1) a large-area gamma-ray detector using the new CdZnTe detectors, (2) an autonomous rapid-slewing spacecraft, (3) a multiwavelength payload combining optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray instruments, (4) an observing program coordinated with other ground-based and space-based observatories, and (5) immediate multiwavelength data flow to the community. The mission is currently funded for 2 yr of operations, and the spacecraft will have a lifetime to orbital decay of {\~{}}8 yr.},

abstract = {In this paper we compute rest-frame extinctions for the afterglows of a sample of gamma-ray bursts complete in redshift. The selection criteria of the sample are based on observational high-energy parameters of the prompt emission and therefore our sample should not be biased against dusty sight-lines. It is therefore expected that our inferences hold for the general population of gamma-ray bursts. Our main result is that the optical/near-infrared extinction of gamma-ray burst afterglows in our sample does not follow a single distribution. 87{\%} of the events are absorbed by less than 2 mag, and 50{\%} suffer from less than 0.3-0.4 mag extinction. The remaining 13{\%} of the afterglows are highly absorbed. The true percentage of gamma-ray burst afterglows showing high absorption could be even higher since a fair fraction of the events without reliable redshift measurement are probably part of this class. These events may be due to highly dusty molecular clouds/star forming regions associated with the gamma-ray burst progenitor or along the afterglow line of sight, and/or to massive dusty host galaxies. No clear evolution in the dust extinction properties is evident within the redshift range of our sample, although the largest extinctions are at z$\backslash${\~{}}1.5-2, close to the expected peak of the star formation rate. Those events classified as dark are characterized, on average, by a higher extinction than typical events in the sample. A correlation between optical/near-infrared extinction and hydrogen-equivalent column density based on X-ray studies is shown although the observed NH appears to be well in excess compared to those observed in the Local Group. Dust extinction does not seem to correlate with GRB energetics or luminosity.},

abstract = {We derive the luminosity function and redshift distribution of short Gamma Ray Bursts (SGRBs) using (i) all the available observer-frame constraints (i.e. peak flux, fluence, peak energy and duration distributions) of the large population of Fermi SGRBs and (ii) the rest-frame properties of a complete sample of Swift SGRBs. We show that a steep {\$}\backslashphi(L)\backslashpropto L{\^{}}{\{}-a{\}}{\$} with a{\textgreater}2.0 is excluded if the full set of constraints is considered. We implement a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to derive the {\$}\backslashphi(L){\$} and {\$}\backslashpsi(z){\$} functions assuming intrinsic Ep-Liso and Ep-Eiso correlations or independent distributions of intrinsic peak energy, luminosity and duration. To make our results independent from assumptions on the progenitor (NS-NS binary mergers or other channels) and from uncertainties on the star formation history, we assume a parametric form for the redshift distribution of SGRBs. We find that a relatively flat luminosity function with slope {\~{}}0.5 below a characteristic break luminosity {\~{}}3{\$}\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}52{\}}{\$} erg/s and a redshift distribution of SGRBs peaking at z{\~{}}1.5-2 satisfy all our constraints. These results hold also if no Ep-Liso and Ep-Eiso correlations are assumed.

Assuming current estimates of NS-NS merger rates and that all NS-NS mergers lead to a SGRB event, we derive a conservative estimate of the average opening angle of SGRBs: {\$}\backslashtheta{\_}{\{}jet{\}}{\$}{\~{}}3-6 deg. Our luminosity function implies an average luminosity L{\~{}}1.5{\$}\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}52{\}}{\$} erg/s, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than previous findings, which greatly enhances the chance of observing SGRB "orphan" afterglows. Efforts should go in the direction of finding and identifying such orphan afterglows as counterparts of GW events.},

abstract = {We present observations of the afterglows and host galaxies of three short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs): 100625A, 101219A and 110112A. We find that GRB 100625A occurred in a z=0.452 early-type galaxy with a stellar mass of 4.6e9 M{\_}Sun and a stellar population age of 0.7 Gyr, and GRB 101219A originated in a star-forming galaxy at z=0.718 with a stellar mass of 1.4e9 M{\_}Sun, a star formation rate of 16 M{\_}Sun yr{\^{}}-1, and a stellar population age of 50 Myr. We also report the discovery of the optical afterglow of GRB 110112A, which lacks a coincident host galaxy to i{\textgreater}26 mag and we cannot conclusively identify any field galaxy as a possible host. The bursts have inferred circumburst densities of {\~{}}1e-4-1 cm{\^{}}-3, and isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray and kinetic energies of 1e50-1e51 erg. These events highlight the diversity of galaxies that host short GRBs. To quantify this diversity, we use the sample of 36 Swift short GRBs with robust associations to an environment ({\~{}}1/2 of 68 short bursts detected by Swift to May 2012) and classify them as follows: late-type (50{\%}), early-type (15{\%}), inconclusive (20{\%}), and host-less (lacking a coincident host galaxy to limits of {\textgreater}26 mag; 15{\%}). To find likely ranges for the true late- and early-type fractions, we assign each of the host-less bursts to the late- or early-type category using probabilistic arguments, and consider the scenario that all hosts in the inconclusive category are early-type galaxies to set an upper bound on the early-type fraction. The most likely ranges for the late- and early-type fractions are {\~{}}60-80{\%} and {\~{}}20-40{\%}, respectively. We find no clear trend between gamma-ray duration and host type, and no change to the fractions when excluding events recently claimed as possible contaminants from the long GRB/collapsar population. Our reported demographics are consistent with a short GRB rate driven by both stellar mass and star formation.},

abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{\textgreater}{\~{}}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc{\~{}}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass $\sigma${\~{}}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc{\~{}}0.2 Msolar and $\sigma${\~{}}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD{\~{}}n*{\~{}}0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {\textgreater}{\~{}}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc{\~{}}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\~{}}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'{e}}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are known to come in two duration classes, separated at approximately 2 s. Long-duration bursts originate from star-forming regions in galaxies, have accompanying supernovae when these are near enough to observe and are probably caused by massive-star collapsars. Recent observations show that short-duration bursts originate in regions within their host galaxies that have lower star-formation rates, consistent with binary neutron star or neutron star-black hole mergers. Moreover, although their hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no supernovae have been so far associated with short-duration GRBs. Here we report that the bright, nearby GRB 060614 does not fit into either class. Its approximately 102-s duration groups it with long-duration GRBs, while its temporal lag and peak luminosity fall entirely within the short-duration GRB subclass. Moreover, very deep optical observations exclude an accompanying supernova, similar to short-duration GRBs. This combination of a long-duration event without an accompanying supernova poses a challenge to both the collapsar and the merging-neutron-star interpretations and opens the door to a new GRB classification scheme that straddles both long- and short-duration bursts.},

abstract = {The majority of Swift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed at z {\textgreater} 6 have prompt durations of T90 {\textless} 30s, which, at first sight, is surprising given that cosmological time-dilation means this corresponds to {\textless} 5s in their rest frames. We have tested whether these high-redshift GRBs are consistent with being drawn from the same population as those observed at low-redshift by comparing them to an artificially red-shifted sample of 114 z {\textless} 4 bursts. This is accomplished using two methods to produce realistic high-z simulations of light curves based on the observed characteristics of the low-z sample. In Method 1 we use the Swift/BAT data directly, taking the photons detected in the harder bands to predict what would be seen in the softest energy band if the burst were seen at higher-z. In Method 2 we fit the light curves with a model, and use that to extrapolate the expected behaviour over the whole BAT energy range at any redshift. Based on the results of Method 2, a K-S test of their durations finds a {\~{}}1{\%} probability that the high-z GRB sample is drawn from the same population as the bright low-z sample. Although apparently marginally significant, we must bear in mind that this test was partially a posteriori, since the rest-frame short durations of several high-z bursts motivated the study in the first instance.},

abstract = {We investigate the afterglow properties and large-scale environments of several short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with subarcsecond optical afterglow positions but no bright coincident host galaxies. The purpose of this joint study is to robustly assess the possibility of significant offsets, a hallmark of the compact object binary merger model. Five such events exist in the current sample of 20 short bursts with optical afterglows, and we find that their optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray emission are systematically fainter. These differences may be due to lower circumburst densities (by about an order of magnitude), to higher redshifts (by $\Delta$z ≈ 0.5-1), or to lower energies (by about a factor of 3), although in the standard GRB model the smaller $\gamma$-ray fluences cannot be explained by lower densities. To study the large-scale environments, we use deep optical observations to place limits on underlying hosts and to determine probabilities of chance coincidence for galaxies near each burst. In four of the five cases, the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence (P({\textless}$\delta$R) {\~{}} 0.1) are associated with bright galaxies at separations of $\delta$R {\~{}} 10'', while somewhat higher probabilities of chance coincidence are associated with faint galaxies at separations of {\~{}}2''. By measuring redshifts for the brighter galaxies in three cases (z = 0.111, 0.473, 0.403), we find physical offsets of ≈30-75 kpc, while for the faint hosts the assumption of z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1 leads to offsets of {\~{}}15 kpc. Alternatively, the limits at the burst positions (gsim26 mag) can be explained by typical short GRB host galaxies (L ≈ 0.1-1 L*) at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2-3. Thus, two possibilities exist: (1) {\~{}}1/4 of short GRBs explode {\~{}}50 kpc or {\~{}}15 kpc from the centers of z {\~{}} 0.3 or z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1 galaxies, respectively, and have fainter afterglows due to the resulting lower densities; or (2) {\~{}}1/4 of short GRBs occur at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2 and have fainter afterglows due to their higher redshifts. The high-redshift scenario leads to a bimodal redshift distribution, with peaks at z {\~{}} 0.5 and z {\~{}} 3. The large offset scenario leads to an offset distribution that is well matched by theoretical predictions of NS-NS/NS-BH binary kicks, or by a hybrid population with globular cluster NS-NS binaries at large offsets and primordial binaries at offsets of lsim10 kpc (indicative of negligible kicks). Deeper constraints on any coincident galaxies to gsim28 mag (using the Hubble Space Telescope) will allow us to better exclude the high-redshift scenario.},

abstract = {The Collapsar model provides a theoretical framework for the well-known association between long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and collapsing massive stars. A bipolar relativistic jet, launched at the core of a collapsing star, drills its way through the stellar envelope and breaks out of the surface before producing the observed gamma rays. While a wealth of observations associate GRBs with the death of massive stars, as yet there is no direct evidence for the Collapsar model itself. Here we show that a distinct signature of the Collapsar model is the appearance of a plateau in the duration distribution of the prompt GRB emission at times much shorter than the typical breakout time of the jet. This plateau is evident in the data of all three major satellites. Our findings provide evidence that directly supports the Collapsar model. In addition, the model suggests the existence of a large population of choked (failed) GRBs, and implies that the 2 s duration commonly used to separate Collapsars and non-Collapsars is inconsistent with the duration distributions of Swift and Fermi GRBs and only holds for BATSE GRBs.},

These advances have opened new perspectives on the nature and properties of burst central engines, interactions with the burst environment from microparsec to gigaparsec scales, and the possibilities for nonphotonic signatures.

abstract = {Nearly 20{\%} of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) have no observed host galaxies. Combining this finding with constraints on galaxies' dark matter halo potential wells gives strong limits on the natal kick velocity distribution for sGRB progenitors. For the best-fitting velocity distribution, one in five sGRB progenitors receives a natal kick above 150 km s ?1 , consistent with merging neutron star models but not with merging white dwarf binary models. This progenitor model constraint is robust to a wide variety of systematic uncertainties, including the sGRB progenitor time-delay model, the Swift redshift sensitivity, and the shape of the natal kick velocity distribution. We also use constraints on the galaxy-halo connection to determine the host halo and host galaxy demographics for sGRBs, which match extremely well with available data. Most sGRBs are expected to occur in halos near 10 12 M ? and in galaxies near 5 ? 10 10 M ? ( L * ); unobserved faint and high-redshift host galaxies contribute a small minority of the observed hostless sGRB fraction. We find that sGRB redshift distributions and host galaxy stellar masses weakly constrain the progenitor time-delay model; the active versus passive fraction of sGRB host galaxies may offer a stronger constraint. Finally, we discuss how searches for gravitational wave optical counterparts in the local universe can reduce follow-up times using these findings.},

Utilizing the high angular resolution and depth of HST, we characterize the host galaxy morphologies, measure precise projected physical and host-normalized offsets between the bursts and host centers, and calculate the locations of the bursts with respect to their host light distributions (rest-frame UV and optical). We calculate a median short GRB projected physical offset of 4.5 kpc, about 3.5 times larger than that for long GRBs, and find that {\~{}}25{\%} of short GRBs have offsets of {\textgreater}10 kpc.

Therefore, short GRBs do not occur in regions of star formation or even stellar mass. This demonstrates that the progenitor systems of short GRBs must migrate from their birth sites to their eventual explosion sites, a signature of kicks in compact object binary systems. Utilizing the full sample of offsets, we estimate natal kick velocities of {\~{}}20-140 km s{\^{}}-1.

Such a signal would arise from 0.05 ncomms12898-m1gif2152914 r-process material launched by a compact binary merger. The implied mass ejection supports the suggestion that compact binary mergers are significant and possibly main sites of heavy r-process nucleosynthesis. Furthermore, we have reanalysed all afterglow data from nearby short and hybrid GRBs (shGRBs). A statistical study of shGRB/macronova connection reveals that macronova may have taken place in all these GRBs, although the fraction as low as 0.18 cannot be ruled out. The identification of two of the three macronova candidates in the I-band implies a more promising detection prospect for ground-based surveys.},

abstract = {We introduce the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Host Galaxy Legacy Survey ("SHOALS"), a multi-observatory high-redshift galaxy survey targeting the largest unbiased sample of long-duration gamma-ray burst hosts yet assembled (119 in total). We describe the motivations of the survey and the development of our selection criteria, including an assessment of the impact of various observability metrics on the success rate of afterglow-based redshift measurement. We briefly outline our host-galaxy observational program, consisting of deep Spitzer/IRAC imaging of every field supplemented by similarly-deep, multi-color optical/NIR photometry, plus spectroscopy of events without pre-existing redshifts. Our optimized selection cuts combined with host-galaxy follow-up have so far enabled redshift measurements for 110 targets (92{\%}) and placed upper limits on all but one of the remainder. About 20{\%} of GRBs in the sample are heavily dust-obscured, and at most 2{\%} originate from z{\textgreater}5.5. Using this sample we estimate the redshift-dependent GRB rate density, showing it to peak at z{\~{}}2.5 and fall by about an order of magnitude towards low (z=0) redshift, while declining more gradually towards high (z{\~{}}7) redshift. This behavior is consistent with a progenitor whose formation efficiency varies modestly over cosmic history. Our survey will permit the most detailed examination to date of the connection between the GRB host population and general star-forming galaxies, directly measure evolution in the host population over cosmic time and discern its causes, and provide new constraints on the fraction of cosmic star-formation occurring in undetectable galaxies at all redshifts.},

@article{Nysewander2009,
abstract = {We present a comparative study of the observed properties of the optical and X-ray afterglows of short- and long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs). Using a large sample of 37 short and 421 long GRBs, we find a strong correlation between the afterglow brightness measured after 11 hr and the observed fluence of the prompt emission. Both the optical (R band) and X-ray flux densities (FR and FX ) scale with the $\gamma$-ray fluence, F $\gamma$. For bursts with a known redshift, a tight correlation exists between the afterglow flux densities at 11 hr (rest frame) and the total isotropic $\gamma$-ray energy, E $\gamma$,ISO: F R,X vprop E $\gamma$,ISO $\alpha$, with $\alpha$ sime 1. The constant of proportionality is nearly identical for long and short bursts, when E $\gamma$,ISO is obtained from the Swift data. Additionally, we find that for short busts with F $\gamma$ gsim 10-7 erg cm-2, optical afterglows are nearly always detected by reasonably deep early observations. Finally, we show that the ratio FR /FX has very similar values for short and long bursts. These results are difficult to explain in the framework of the standard scenario, since they require that either (1) the number density of the surrounding medium of short bursts is typically comparable to, or even larger than the number density of long bursts; (2) short bursts explode into a density profile, n(r) vprop r -2 or (3) the prompt $\gamma$-ray fluence depends on the density of the external medium. We therefore find it likely that either basic assumptions on the properties of the circumburst environment of short GRBs or else the standard models of GRB emission must be re-examined. We believe that the most likely solution is that the ambient density surrounding typical short bursts is higher than has generally been expected: a typical value of {\~{}}1 cm-3 is indicated. We discuss recent modifications to the standard binary merger model for short bursts which may be able to explain the implied density.},

abstract = {Our Galaxy, the Milky Way, is a benchmark for understanding disk galaxies. It is the only galaxy whose formation history can be stud- ied using the full distribution of stars from white dwarfs to supergiants. The oldest components provide us with unique insight into how galaxies form and evolve over billions of years. The Galaxy is a luminous (L?) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties, it falls in the sparsely populated “green valley” region of the galaxy colour-magnitude dia- gram. Here we review the key integrated, structural and kinematic pa- rameters of the Galaxy, and point to uncertainties as well as directions for future progress. Galactic studies will continue to play a fundamen- tal role far into the future because there are measurements that can only be made in the near field and much of contemporary astrophysics depends on such observations. 1},

abstract = {[Abridged] We present data and initial results from VLT/X-Shooter emission-line spectroscopy of 96 GRB-selected galaxies at 0.1{\textless}z{\textless}3.6, the largest sample of GRB host spectroscopy available to date. Most of our GRBs were detected by Swift and 76{\%} are at 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.5 with a median z{\~{}}1.6. Based on Balmer and/or forbidden lines of oxygen, nitrogen, and neon, we measure systemic redshifts, star formation rates (SFRs), visual attenuations, oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H)), and emission-line widths. We find a strong change of the typical physical properties of GRB hosts with redshift. The median SFR, for example, increases from {\~{}}0.6 M{\_}sun/yr at z{\~{}}0.6 up to {\~{}}15 M{\_}sun/yr at z{\~{}}2. A higher ratio of [OIII]/[OII] at higher redshifts leads to an increasing distance of GRB-selected galaxies to the locus of local galaxies in the BPT diagram. Oxygen abundances of the galaxies are distributed between 12+log(O/H)=7.9 and 12+log(O/H)=9.0 with a median of 12+log(O/H){\~{}}8.5. The fraction of GRB-selected galaxies with super-solar metallicities is around 20{\%} at z{\textless}1 in the adopted metallicity scale. This is significantly less than the fraction of star formation in similar galaxies, illustrating that GRBs are scarce in high-metallicity environments. At z{\~{}}3, sensitivity limits us to probing only the most luminous GRB hosts for which we derive metallicities of Z {\~{}}{\textless} 0.5 Z{\_}sun. Together with a high incidence of galaxies with similar metallicity in our sample at z{\~{}}1.5, this indicates that the metallicity dependence observed at low redshift will not be dominant at z{\~{}}3.},

abstract = {We present measurements of dust reddening using the colors of stars with spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We measure reddening as the difference between the measured and predicted colors of a star, as derived from stellar parameters from the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline. We achieve uncertainties of 54, 34, 25, and 28 mmag in the colors u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z, per star, though the uncertainty varies depending on the stellar type and the magnitude of the star. The spectrum-based reddening measurements confirm our earlier "blue tip" reddening measurements (Schlafly 2010), finding reddening coefficients different by -4{\%}, 2{\%}, 1{\%}, and 2{\%} in u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z from those found by the blue tip method, after accounting for a small 4{\%} normalization effect plausibly caused by the different sky footprint available for this analysis. These results prefer an R{\_}V=3.1 Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening law to O'Donnell (1994) or Cardelli (1989) reddening laws. We provide a table of conversion coefficients from the Schlegel et al. (1998, SFD) maps of E(B-V) to extinction in 88 bandpasses for 4 values of R{\_}V using this reddening law. These coefficients supersede those in SFD and amount to a recalibration of SFD.},

@article{Kann2011,
abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been separated into two classes, originally along the lines of duration and spectral properties, called "short/hard" and "long/soft." The latter have been conclusively linked to the explosive deaths of massive stars, while the former are thought to result from the merger or collapse of compact objects. In recent years, indications have been accumulating that the short/hard versus long/soft division does not map directly onto what would be expected from the two classes of progenitors, leading to a new classification scheme called Type I and Type II which is based on multiple observational criteria. We use a large sample of GRB afterglow and prompt-emission data (adding further GRB afterglow observations in this work) to compare the optical afterglows (or the lack thereof) of Type I GRBs with those of Type II GRBs. In comparison to the afterglows of Type II GRBs, we find that those of Type I GRBs have a lower average luminosity and show an intrinsic spread of luminosities at least as wide. From late and deep upper limits on the optical transients, we establish limits on the maximum optical luminosity of any associated supernova (SN), confirming older works and adding new results. We use deep upper limits on Type I GRB optical afterglows to constrain the parameter space of possible mini-SN emission associated with a compact-object merger. Using the prompt-emission data, we search for correlations between the parameters of the prompt emission and the late optical afterglow luminosities. We find tentative correlations between the bolometric isotropic energy release and the optical afterglow luminosity at a fixed time after the trigger (positive), and between the host offset and the luminosity (negative), but no significant correlation between the isotropic energy release and the duration of the GRBs. We also discuss three anomalous GRBs, GRB 060505, GRB 060614, and GRB 060121, in light of their optical afterglow luminosities.},

abstract = {It has long been known that there are two classes of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), mainly distinguished by their durations. The breakthrough in our understanding of long-duration GRBs (those lasting more than approximately 2 s), which ultimately linked them with energetic type Ic supernovae, came from the discovery of their long-lived X-ray and optical 'afterglows', when precise and rapid localizations of the sources could finally be obtained. X-ray localizations have recently become available for short (duration {\textless}2 s) GRBs, which have evaded optical detection for more than 30 years. Here we report the first discovery of transient optical emission (R-band magnitude approximately 23) associated with a short burst: GRB 050709. The optical afterglow was localized with subarcsecond accuracy, and lies in the outskirts of a blue dwarf galaxy. The optical and X-ray afterglow properties 34 h after the GRB are reminiscent of the afterglows of long GRBs, which are attributable to synchrotron emission from ultrarelativistic ejecta. We did not, however, detect a supernova, as found in most nearby long GRB afterglows, which suggests a different origin for the short GRBs.},

abstract = {It is now accepted that long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced during the collapse of a massive star. The standard 'collapsar' model predicts that a broad-lined and luminous type Ic core-collapse supernova accompanies every long-duration GRB. This association has been confirmed in observations of several nearby GRBs. Here we report that GRB 060505 (ref. 10) and GRB 060614 (ref. 11) were not accompanied by supernova emission down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal supernova SN 1998bw that accompanied GRB 980425, and fainter than any type Ic supernova ever observed. Multi-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of the host galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and show that the bursts originated in actively star-forming regions. The absence of a supernova to such deep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long-duration GRBs and suggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death.},

abstract = {When massive stars exhaust their fuel, they collapse and often produce the extraordinarily bright explosions known as core-collapse supernovae. On occasion, this stellar collapse also powers an even more brilliant relativistic explosion known as a long-duration gamma-ray burst. One would then expect that these long gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae should be found in similar galactic environments. Here we show that this expectation is wrong. We find that the gamma-ray bursts are far more concentrated in the very brightest regions of their host galaxies than are the core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, the host galaxies of the long gamma-ray bursts are significantly fainter and more irregular than the hosts of the core-collapse supernovae. Together these results suggest that long-duration gamma-ray bursts are associated with the most extremely massive stars and may be restricted to galaxies of limited chemical evolution. Our results directly imply that long gamma-ray bursts are relatively rare in galaxies such as our own Milky Way.},

abstract = {Compact binary mergers are the strongest candidates for the progenitors of Short Gamma Ray Bursts (SGRBs). If a gravitational wave (GW) signal from the compact binary merger is observed in association with a SGRB, such a synergy can help us understand many interesting aspects of these bursts. We examine the accuracies with which a world wide network of gravitational wave interferometers would measure the inclination angle (the angle between the angular momentum axis of the binary and the observer's line of sight) of the binary. We compare the projected accuracies of GW detectors to measure the inclination angle of double neutron star (DNS) and neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) binaries for different astrophysical scenarios. We find that a 5 detector network can measure the inclination angle to an accuracy of {\$}\backslashsim 5.1 (2.2){\$} degrees for a DNS(NS-BH) system at 200 Mpc if the direction of the source as well as the redshift is known electromagnetically. We argue as to how an accurate estimation of the inclination angle of the binary can prove to be crucial in understanding off-axis GRBs, the dynamics and the energetics of their jets, and help the searches for (possible) orphan afterglows of the SGRBs.},

abstract = {The coalescence of compact objects are a promising astrophysical sources of gravitational wave (GW) signals. The ejection of r-process material from such mergers may lead to a radioactively-powered electromagnetic counterpart which, if discovered, would enhance the science return of a GW detection. As very little is known about the optical properties of heavy r-process elements, previous light curve models have adopted opacities similar to those of iron group elements. Here we report that the presence of heavier elements, particularly the lanthanides, increase the ejecta opacity by several orders of magnitude. We include these higher opacities in time dependent, multi-wavelength radiative transport calculations to predict the broadband light curves of one-dimensional models over a range of parameters (ejecta masses from 0.001 to 0.1 solar masses and velocities from 0.1 to 0.3c). We find that the higher opacities lead to much longer duration light curves which can last a week or more. The emission is shifted toward the infrared bands due to strong optical line blanketing, and the colors at later times are representative of a blackbody near the recombination temperature of the lanthanides (T {\~{}} 2500K). We further consider the case in which a second mass outflow, composed of 56Ni, is ejected from a disk wind, and show that the net result is a distinctive two component spectral energy distribution, with a bright optical peak due to 56Ni and an infrared peak due to r-process ejecta. We briefly consider the prospects for detection and identification of these transients.},

abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 $\mu$m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 $\mu$m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 $\mu$m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 $\mu$m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 $\mu$m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 $\mu$m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 ± 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 $\mu$m and of 17 ± 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 $\mu$m (95{\%} confidence). This integrated flux {\~{}}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 $\mu$m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

abstract = {Using integrated optical spectrophotometry for 412 star-forming galaxies at z{\~{}}0, and fiber-aperture spectrophotometry for 120,846 SDSS galaxies at z{\~{}}0.1, we investigate the H$\alpha$ $\lambda$6563, H$\beta$ $\lambda$4861, [O II] $\lambda$3727, and [O III] $\lambda$5007 nebular emission lines and the U-band luminosity as quantitative star formation rate (SFR) indicators. We demonstrate that the extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ $\lambda$6563 luminosity is a reliable SFR tracer even in highly obscured star-forming galaxies. We find that variations in dust reddening dominate the systematic uncertainty in SFRs derived from the observed H$\beta$, [O II], and U-band luminosities, producing a factor of {\~{}}1.7, {\~{}}2.5, and {\~{}}2.1 scatter in the mean transformations, respectively. We show that [O II] depends weakly on variations in oxygen abundance over a wide range in metallicity, 12+log(O/H)=8.15-8.7 (Z/Zsolar=0.28-1.0), and that in this metallicity interval galaxies occupy a narrow range in ionization parameter (-3.8{\textless}{\~{}}logU{\textless}{\~{}}-2.9). We show that the scatter in [O III] $\lambda$5007 as a SFR indicator is a factor of 3-4 due to its sensitivity to metal abundance and ionization. We develop empirical SFR calibrations for H$\beta$ and [O II] parameterized in terms of the B-band luminosity, which remove the systematic effects of reddening and metallicity and reduce the SFR scatter to +/-40{\%} and +/-90{\%}, respectively, although individual galaxies may deviate substantially from the median relations. Finally, we compare the z{\~{}}0 relations between blue luminosity and reddening, ionization, and [O II]/H$\alpha$ ratio against measurements at z{\~{}}1 and find broad agreement. We emphasize, however, that optical emission-line measurements including H$\alpha$ for larger samples of intermediate- and high-redshift galaxies are needed to test the applicability of our locally derived SFR calibrations to distant galaxies.},

The faint R-band afterglow is seen to decline astt , indicating the presence ?0.66?0.09 while the X-ray falls as ?1.18?0.04 of the cooling break between the two frequencies. However, the R-band afterglow is very faint compared to the predicted extrapolation of the X-ray afterglow to the optical regime (specifically, b ∼ 0.2OX ), while the K-band is consistent with this extrapolation (b ∼ 0.6KX ), demonstrating suppression of the optical flux. Late-time HST observations place stringent limits on the afterglow R-band flux, implying a break in the R-band light curve. They also show that the burst occurred at the edge of a faint red galaxy, presumably the host, which most likely lies at a significantly higher redshift than the previous optically identified short-duration bursts. Several neighboring galaxies also have very red colors that are similarly suggestive of higher redshift. The least extreme explanation for the faintness and color of the burst is that it occurred at moderately high redshift and was significantly obscured; however, it is also possible that it lies at z 1 4.5, in which case the faintness of the R-band afterglow could be attributed to the Lyman break.We discuss the implications that either scenario would have for the nature of the progenitors of short bursts.},

For many years long GRBs were the focus of intense research while the lack of observational data limited the study of short-hard GRBs (SHBs). In 2005 a breakthrough occurred following the first detections of SHB afterglows, longer wavelength emission that follows the burst of gamma-rays. Similarly to long GRBs, afterglow detections led to the identification of SHB host galaxies and measurement of their redshifts. These observations established that SHBs are cosmological relativistic sources that, unlike long GRBs, do not originate from the collapse of massive stars, and therefore constitute a distinct physical phenomenon. One viable model for SHB origin is the coalescence of compact binary systems (double neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole), in which case SHBs are the electromagnetic counterparts of strong gravitational-wave sources. The theoretical and observational study of SHBs following the recent pivotal discoveries is reviewed, along with new theoretical results that are presented here for the first time. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We measure their X-ray absorbing column densities and collect data on the host galaxy offsets. We find evidence for intrinsic absorption and no correlation between the intrinsic absorbing column density and the projected offset of the GRB from its host galaxy centre. We find that the properties in the gamma regime (T90, fluence and 1-s peak photon flux) of short GRBs with 'bright' and 'faint' X-ray afterglow likely disfavour different prompt emission mechanisms. The host galaxy offset and GRB duration (T90) do not correlate. Instead, there is a hint of anticorrelation between the effective radius normalized host galaxy offset and T90. Finally, we examine the properties of short GRBs with short-lived and long-lived X-ray afterglows, finding that some short GRBs with short-lived X-ray afterglows have their optical afterglow detected. In light of this, the X-ray afterglow duration does not seem to be a unique indicator of a specific progenitor and/or environment for short GRBs.},

abstract = {The dynamical mass (M{\_}dyn) is a key property of any galaxy, yet a determination of M{\_}dyn is not straight-forward if spatially resolved measurements are not available. This situation occurs in single-dish HI observations of the local universe, but also frequently in high-redshift observations. M{\_}dyn-measurements in high-redshift galaxies are commonly obtained through observations of the CO line, the most abundant tracer of the molecular medium. Even though the CO linewidth can in most cases be determined with reasonable accuracy, a measurement of the size of the emitting region is typically challenging given current facilities. We show how the integrated spectra (`global profiles') of a variety of galaxy models depend on the spatial distribution of the tracer gas as well as its velocity dispersion. We demonstrate that the choice of tracer emission line significantly affects the shape of the global profiles. In particular, in the case of high ({\~{}}50 kms-1) velocity dispersions, compact tracers (such as CO) result in Gaussian-like (non-double-horned) profiles, as is indeed frequently seen in high-redshift observations. We determine at which radii the rotation curve reaches the rotation velocity corresponding to the velocity width, and find that for each tracer this happens at a well-defined radius: HI velocity widths typically originate at {\~{}}5 optical scale lengths, while CO velocity widths trace the rotation velocity at {\~{}}2 scale lengths. We additionally explore other distributions to take into account that CO distributions at high redshift likely differ from those at low redshift. Our models, while not trying to reproduce individual galaxies, define characteristic radii that can be used in conjunction with the measured velocity widths in order to define dynamical masses consistent with the assumed gas distribution.},
